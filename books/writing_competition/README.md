A journal for original content for aspiring writers and storytellers

Email us to get published

We have a few different categories you can contribute to

- Short story  

Fables, tales, novella, ballads

- Weekly Serie 

Think chapter book, periodical literature, pulp fiction, netflix etc. A new chapter is published at regular intervals.

- Poetry

Anything from couplets to epics


Within these categories you can feel free to explore any genres: histroical fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, alternate histories, adventure whatever. Or make up your own genre. Once we get a certain number of writers we may start doing awards or contests, etc. in different fields.

The current planned contest is best weekly chapter/episode
