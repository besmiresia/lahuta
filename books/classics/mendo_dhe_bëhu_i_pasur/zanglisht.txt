WHAT DO YOU WANT MOST?
Is It Money, Fame, Power,
Contentment, Personality,
Peace of Mind, Happiness?
The Thirteen Steps to Riches described in this book offer the shortest
dependable philosophy of individual achievement ever presented for the benefit
of the man or woman who is searching for a definite goal in life.
Before beginning the book you will profit greatly if you recognize the fact
that the book was not written to entertain. You cannot digest the contents properly
in a week or a month.
After reading the book thoroughly, Dr. Miller Reese Hutchison, nationally
known Consulting Engineer and long-time associate of Thomas A. Edison, said—
"This is not a novel. It is a textbook on individual achievement that came directly
from the experiences of hundreds of America's most successful men. It should be
studied, digested, and meditated upon. No more than one chapter should be read
in a single night. The reader should underline the sentences which impress him
most. Later, he should go back to these marked lines and read them again. A real
student will not merely read this book, he will absorb its contents and make them his
own. This book should be adopted by all high schools and no boy or girl should
be permitted to graduate without having satisfactorily passed an examination on
it. This philosophy will not take the place of the subjects taught in schools, but it
will enable one to organize and apply the knowledge acquired, and convert it into
useful service and adequate compensation without waste of time.
Dr. John R. Turner, Dean of the College of The City of New York, after
having read the book, said— "The very best example of the soundness of this
philosophy is your own son, Blair, whose dramatic story you have outlined in
the chapter on Desire."
Dr. Turner had reference to the author's son, who, born without normal
hearing capacity, not only avoided becoming a deaf mute, but actually converted
his handicap into a priceless asset by applying the philosophy here described.
After reading the story (starting on page 52), you will realize that you are about
to come into possession of a philosophy which can be transmuted into material
wealth, or serve as readily to bring you peace of mind, understanding, spiritual


harmony, and in some instances, as in the case of the author's son, it can. help
you master physical affliction.
The author discovered, through personally analyzing hundreds of
successful men, that all of them followed the habit of exchanging ideas, through
what is commonly called conferences. When they had problems to be solved they
sat down together and talked freely until they discovered, from their joint
contribution of ideas, a plan that would serve their purpose.
You, who read this book, will get most out of it by putting into practice
the Master Mind principle described in the book. This you can do (as others are
doing so successfully) by forming a study club, consisting of any desired number
of people who are friendly and harmonious. The club should have a meeting at
regular periods, as often as once each week. The procedure should consist of
reading one chapter of the book at each meeting, after which the contents of the
chapter should be freely discussed by all members. Each member should make
notes, putting down ALL IDEAS OF HIS OWN inspired by the discussion. Each
member should carefully read and analyze each chapter several days prior to its
open reading and joint discussion in the club. The reading at the club should be
done by someone who reads well and understands how to put color and feeling
into the lines.
By following this plan every reader will get from its pages, not only the
sum total of the best knowledge organized from the experiences of hundreds of
successful men, but more important by far, he will tap new sources of knowledge in
his own mind as well as acquire knowledge of priceless value FROM EVERY OTHER
PERSON PRESENT.
If you follow this plan persistently you will be almost certain to uncover
and appropriate the secret formula by which Andrew Carnegie acquired his
huge fortune, as referred to in the author's introduction.
TRIBUTES TO THE AUTHOR
From Great American Leaders
"THINK AND GROW RICH" was 25 years in the making. It is Napoleon
Hill's newest book, based upon his famous Law of Success Philosophy. His work
and writings have been praised by great leaders in Finance, Education, Politics,
Government.


Supreme Court of the United States
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Hill:— I have now had an opportunity to finish reading your Law of
Success textbooks and I wish to express my appreciation of the splendid work
you have done in the organization of this philosophy. It would be helpful if
every politician in the country would assimilate and apply the 17 principles upon
which your lessons are based. It contains some very fine material which every
leader in every walk of life should understand. I am happy to have had the
privilege of rendering you some slight measure of help in the organization of this
splendid course of "common sense" philosophy.
Sincerely yours

(Former President and former Chief Justice of the United States)

KING OF THE 5 AND 10 CENT STORES
"By applying many of the 17 fundamentals of the Law of Success
philosophy we have built a great chain of successful stores. I presume it would
be no exaggeration of fact if I said that the Woolworth Building might properly
be called a monument to the soundness of these principles."
F. W. WOOLWORTH
A GREAT STEAMSHIP MAGNATE
"I feel greatly indebted for the privilege of reading your Law of Success. If
I had had this philosophy fifty years ago, I suppose I could have accomplished
all that I have done in less than half the time. I sincerely hope the world will
discover and reward you."
ROBERT DOLLAR


FAMOUS AMERICAN LABOR LEADER
"Mastery of the Law of Success philosophy is the equivalent of an
insurance policy against failure."
SAMUEL GOMPERS
A FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
"May I not congratulate you on your persistence. Any man who devotes
that much time . . . must of necessity make discoveries of great value to others. I
am deeply impressed by your interpretation of the 'Master Mind' principles
which you have so clearly described."
WOODROW WILSON
A MERCHANT PRINCE
"I know that your 17 fundamentals of success are sound because I have
been applying them in my business for more than 30 years."
JOHN WANAMAKER
WORLD'S LARGEST MAKER OF CAMERAS
"I know that you are doing a world of good with your Law of Success. I
would not care to set a monetary value on this training because it brings to the
student qualities which cannot be measured by money, alone."
GEORGE EASTMAN
A NATIONALLY KNOWN BUSINESS CHIEF
"Whatever success I may have attained I owe, entirely, to the application
of your 17 fundamental principles of the Law of Success. I believe I have the
honor of being your first student."
W.M.. WRIGLEY, JR.


PUBLISHER'S PREFACE
THIS book conveys the experience of more than 500 men of great wealth,
who began at scratch, with nothing to give in return for riches except
THOUGHTS, IDEAS and ORGANIZED PLANS.
Here you have the entire philosophy of moneymaking, just as it was
organized from the actual achievements of the most successful men known to the
American people during the past fifty years. It describes WHAT TO DO, also,
HOW TO DO IT!
It presents complete instructions on HOW TO SELL YOUR PERSONAL
SERVICES.
It provides you with a perfect system of self-analysis that will readily
disclose what has been standing between you and "the big money" in the past.
It describes the famous Andrew Carnegie formula of personal
achievement by which he accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars for
himself and made no fewer than a score of millionaires of men to whom he
taught his secret.
Perhaps you do not need all that is to be found in the book— no one of the
500 men from whose experiences it was written did— but you may need ONE
IDEA, PLAN OR SUGGESTION to start you toward your goal. Somewhere in
the book you will find this needed stimulus.
The book was inspired by Andrew Carnegie, after he had made his
millions and retired. It was written by the man to whom Carnegie disclosed the
astounding secret of his riches— the same man to whom the 500 wealthy men
revealed the source of their riches.
In this volume will be found the thirteen principles of money-making
essential to every person who accumulates sufficient money to guarantee
financial independence. It is estimated that the research which went into the
preparation, before the book was written, or could be written— research
covering more than twenty-five years of continuous effort— could not be
duplicated at a cost of less than $100,000.00.
Moreover, the knowledge contained in the book never can be duplicated,
at any cost, for the reason that more than half of the 500 men who supplied the
information it brings have passed on.
Riches cannot always be measured in money!


Money and material things are essential for freedom of body and mind,
but there are some who will feel that the greatest of all riches can be evaluated
only in terms of lasting friendships, harmonious family relationships, sympathy
and understanding between business associates, and introspective harmony
which brings one peace of mind measurable only in spiritual values!
All who read, understand and apply this philosophy will be better
prepared to attract and enjoy these higher estates which always have been and
always will be denied to all except those who are ready for them.
Be prepared, therefore, when you expose yourself to the influence of this
philosophy, to experience a CHANGED LIFE which may help you not only to
negotiate your way through life with harmony and understanding, but also to
prepare you for the accumulation of material riches in abundance.
THE PUBLISHER.


AUTHOR'S PREFACE
IN EVERY chapter of this book, mention has been made of the moneymaking secret which has made fortunes for more than five hundred exceedingly
wealthy men whom I have carefully analyzed over a long period of years.
The secret was brought to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, more than a
quarter of a century ago. The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it
into my mind, when I was but a boy. Then he sat back in his chair, with a merry
twinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough to
understand the full significance of what he had said to me.
When he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing to
spend twenty years or more, preparing myself to take it to the world, to men and
women who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. I said I would,
and with Mr. Carnegie's cooperation, I have kept my promise.
This book contains the secret, after having been put to a practical test by
thousands of people, in almost every walk of life. It was Mr. Carnegie's idea that
the magic formula, which gave him a stupendous fortune, ought to be placed
within reach of people who do not have time to investigate how men make
money, and it was his hope that I might test and demonstrate the soundness of
the formula through the experience of men and women in every calling. He
believed the formula should be taught in all public schools and colleges, and
expressed the opinion that if it were properly taught it would so revolutionize
the entire educational system that the time spent in school could be reduced to
less than half.
His experience with Charles M. Schwab, and other young men of Mr.
Schwab's type, convinced Mr. Carnegie that much of that which is taught in the
schools is of no value whatsoever in connection with the business of earning a
living or accumulating riches. He had arrived at this decision, because he had
taken into his business one young man after another, many of them with but
little schooling, and by coaching them in the use of this formula, developed in
them rare leadership. Moreover, his coaching made fortunes for everyone of them who
followed his instructions.
In the chapter on Faith, you will read the astounding story of the
organization of the giant United States Steel Corporation, as it was conceived and
carried out by one of the young men through whom Mr. Carnegie proved that

his formula will work for all who are ready for it. This single application of the
secret, by that young man— Charles M. Schwab— made him a huge fortune in
both money and OPPORTUNITY. Roughly speaking, this particular application
of the formula was worth six hundred million dollars.
These facts—and they are facts well known to almost everyone who knew
Mr. Carnegie— give you a fair idea of what the reading of this book may bring to
you, provided you KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT.
Even before it had undergone twenty years of practical testing, the secret
was passed on to more than one hundred thousand men and women who have
used it for their personal benefit, as Mr. Carnegie planned that they should. Some
have made fortunes with it. Others have used it successfully in creating harmony
in their homes. A clergyman used it so effectively that it brought him an income
of upwards of $75,000.00 a year.
Arthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his near-bankrupt business as a
"guinea pig" on which to test the formula. The business came to life and made a
fortune for its owners. It is still thriving, although Mr. Nash has gone. The
experiment was so unique that newspapers and magazines, gave it more than a
million dollars' worth of laudatory publicity.
The secret was passed on to Stuart Austin Wier, of Dallas, Texas. He was
ready for it— so ready that he gave up his profession and studied law. Did he
succeed? That story is told too.
I gave the secret to Jennings Randolph, the day he graduated from
College, and he has used it so successfully that he is now serving his third term
as a Member of Congress, with an excellent opportunity to keep on using it until
it carries him to the White House.
While serving as Advertising Manager of the La-Salle Extension
University, when it was little more than a name, I had the privilege of seeing J. G.
Chapline, President of the University, use the formula so effectively that he has
since made the LaSalle one of the great extension schools of the country.
The secret to which I refer has been mentioned no fewer than a hundred
times, throughout this book. It has not been directly named, for it seems to work
more successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in sight, where THOSE
WHO ARE READY, and SEARCHING FOR IT, may pick it up. That is why Mr.
Carnegie tossed it to me so quietly, without giving me its specific name.
If you are READY to put it to use, you will recognize this secret at least
once in every chapter. I wish I might feel privileged to tell you how you will


know if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much of the benefit you
will receive when you make the discovery in your own way.
While this book was being written, my own son, who was then finishing
the last year of his college work, picked up the manuscript of chapter two, read
it, and discovered the secret for himself. He used the information so effectively
that he went directly into a responsible position at a beginning salary greater
than the average man ever earns. His story has been briefly described in chapter
two. When you read it, perhaps you will dismiss any feeling you may have had,
at the beginning of the book, that it promised too much. And, too, if you have
ever been discouraged, if you have had difficulties to surmount which took the
very soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever handicapped
by illness or physical affliction, this story of my son's discovery and use of the
Carnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in the Desert of Lost Hope, for which
you have been searching.
This secret was extensively used by President Woodrow Wilson, during
the World War. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in the war,
carefully wrapped in the training received before going to the front. President
Wilson told me it was a strong factor in raising the funds needed for the war.
More than twenty years ago, Hon. Manuel L. Quezon (then Resident
Commissioner of the Philippine Islands), was inspired by the secret to gain
freedom for his people. He has gained freedom for the Philippines, and is the
first President of the free state.
A peculiar thing about this secret is that those who once acquire it and use
it, find themselves literally swept on to success, with but little effort, and they
never again submit to failure! If you doubt this, study the names of those who
have used it, wherever they have been mentioned, check their records for
yourself, and be convinced.
There is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!
The secret to which I refer cannot be had without a price, although the
price is far less than its value. It cannot be had at any price by those who are not
intentionally searching for it. It cannot be given away, it cannot be purchased for
money, for the reason that it comes in two parts. One part is already in
possession of those who are ready for it.
The secret serves equally well, all who are ready for it. Education has
nothing to do with it. Long before I was born, the secret had found its way into
the possession of Thomas A. Edison, and he used it so intelligently that he


became the world's leading inventor, although he had but three months of
schooling.
The secret was passed on to a business associate of Mr. Edison. He used it
so effectively that, although he was then making only $12,000 a year, he
accumulated a great fortune, and retired from active business while still a young
man. You will find his story at the beginning of the first chapter. It should
convince you that riches are not beyond your reach, that you can still be what
you wish to be, that money, fame, recognition and happiness can be had by all
who are ready and determined to have these blessings. How do I know these
things? You should have the answer before you finish this book. You may find it
in the very first chapter, or on the last page.
While I was performing the twenty year task of research, which I had
undertaken at Mr. Carnegie's request, I analyzed hundreds of well known men,
many of whom admitted that they had accumulated their vast fortunes through
the aid of the Carnegie secret; among these men were: —

These names represent but a small fraction of the hundreds of well known
Americans whose achievements, financially and otherwise, prove that those who
understand and apply the Carnegie secret, reach high stations in life. I have
never known anyone who was inspired to use the secret, who did not achieve
noteworthy success in his chosen calling. I have never known any person to
distinguish himself, or to accumulate riches of any consequence, without
possession of the secret. From these two facts I draw the conclusion that the
secret is more important, as a part of the knowledge essential for selfdetermination, than any which one receives through what is popularly known as
"education."

What is EDUCATION, anyway? This has been answered in full detail.
As far as schooling is concerned, many of these men had very little. John
Wanamaker once told me that what little schooling he had, he acquired in very
much the same manner as a modern loco-motive takes on water, by "scooping it
up as it runs." Henry Ford never reached high school, let alone college. I am not
attempting to minimize the value of schooling, but I am trying to express my
earnest belief that those who master and apply the secret will reach high stations,
accumulate riches, and bargain with life on their own terms, even if their
schooling has been meager.
Somewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the
page and stand boldly before you, IF YOU ARE READY FOR IT! When it
appears, you will recognize it. Whether you receive the sign in the first or the last
chapter, stop for a moment when it presents itself, and turn down a glass, for that
occasion will mark the most important turning-point of your life.
We pass now, to Chapter One, and to the story of my very dear friend,
who has generously acknowledged having seen the mystic sign, and whose
business achievements are evidence enough that he turned down a glass. As you
read his story, and the others, remember that they deal with the important
problems of life, such as all men experience.
The problems arising from one's endeavor to earn a living, to find hope,
courage, contentment and peace of mind; to accumulate riches and to enjoy
freedom of body and spirit.
Remember, too, as you go through the book, that it deals with facts and
not with fiction, its purpose being to convey a great universal truth through
which all who are READY may learn, not only WHAT TO DO, BUT ALSO HOW
TO DO IT! and receive, as well, THE NEEDED STIMULUS TO MAKE A START.
As a final word of preparation, before you begin the first chapter, may I
offer one brief suggestion which may provide a clue by which the Carnegie
secret may be recognized? It is this— ALL ACHIEVEMENT, ALL EARNED
RICHES, HAVE THEIR BEGINNING IN AN IDEA! If you are ready for the secret,
you already possess one half of it, therefore, you will readily recognize the other
half the moment it reaches your mind.
THE AUTHOR


CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
THE MAN WHO "THOUGHT"
HIS WAY INTO PARTNERSHIP
WITH THOMAS A. EDISON
TRULY, "thoughts are things," and powerful things at that, when they are
mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a BURNING DESIRE for
their translation into riches, or other material objects.
A little more than thirty years ago, Edwin C. Barnes discovered how true
it is that men really do THINK AND GROW RICH. His discovery did not come
about at one sitting. It came little by little, beginning with a BURNING DESIRE
to become a business associate of the great Edison.
One of the chief characteristics of Barnes' Desire was that it was definite.
He wanted to work with Edison, not for him. Observe, carefully, the description
of how he went about translating his DESIRE into reality, and you will have a
better understanding of the thirteen principles which lead to riches.
When this DESIRE, or impulse of thought, first flashed into his mind he
was in no position to act upon it. Two difficulties stood in his way. He did not
know Mr. Edison, and he did not have enough money to pay his railroad fare to
Orange, New Jersey.
These difficulties were sufficient to have discouraged the majority of men
from making any attempt to carry out the desire. But his was no ordinary desire!
He was so determined to find a way to carry out his desire that he finally
decided to travel by "blind baggage," rather than be defeated. (To the uninitiated,
this means that he went to East Orange on a freight train).
He presented himself at Mr. Edison's laboratory, and announced he had
come to go into business with the inventor. In speaking of the first meeting
between Barnes and Edison, years later, Mr. Edison said, "He stood there before
me, looking like an ordinary tramp, but there was something in the expression of his
face which conveyed the impression that he was determined to get what he had come after.
I had learned, from years of experience with men, that when a man really
DESIRES a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single

turn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win. I gave him the opportunity
he asked for, because I saw he had made up his mind to stand by until he succeeded.
Subsequent events proved that no mistake was made."
Just what young Barnes said to Mr. Edison on that occasion was far less
important than that which he thought. Edison, himself, said so! It could not have
been the young man's appearance which got him his start in the Edison office, for
that was definitely against him. It was what he THOUGHT that counted.
If the significance of this statement could be conveyed to every person
who reads it, there would be no need for the remainder of this book.
Barnes did not get his partnership with Edison on his first interview. He
did get a chance to work in the Edison offices, at a very nominal wage, doing
work that was unimportant to Edison, but most important to Barnes, because it
gave him an opportunity to display his "merchandise" where his intended
"partner" could see it.
Months went by. Apparently nothing happened to bring the coveted goal
which Barnes had set up in his mind as his DEFINITE MAJOR PURPOSE. But
something important was happening in Barnes' mind. He was constantly
intensifying his DESIRE to become the business associate of Edison.
Psychologists have correctly said that "when one is truly ready for a thing,
it puts in its appearance."
Barnes was ready for a business association with Edison, moreover, he
was DETERMINED TO REMAIN READY UNTIL HE GOT THAT WHICH HE
WAS SEEKING.
He did not say to himself, "Ah well, what's the use? I guess I'll change my
mind and try for a salesman's job." But, he did say, "I came here to go into
business with Edison, and I'll accomplish this end if it takes the remainder of my
life." He meant it! What a different story men would have to tell if only they
would adopt a DEFINITE PURPOSE, and stand by that purpose until it had time
to become an all-consuming obsession!
Maybe young Barnes did not know it at the time, but his bulldog
determination, his persistence in standing back of a single DESIRE, was destined
to mow down all opposition, and bring him the opportunity he was seeking.
When the opportunity came, it appeared in a different form, and from a
different direction than Barnes had expected. That is one of the tricks of
opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes
disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so
many fail to recognize opportunity.

Mr. Edison had just perfected a new office device, known at that time, as
the Edison Dictating Machine (now the Ediphone). His salesmen were not
enthusiastic over the machine. They did not believe it could be sold without great
effort. Barnes saw his opportunity. It had crawled in quietly, hidden in a queer
looking machine which interested no one but Barnes and the inventor.
Barnes knew he could sell the Edison Dictating Machine. He suggested
this to Edison, and promptly got his chance. He did sell the machine. In fact, he
sold it so successfully that Edison gave him a contract to distribute and market it
all over the nation. Out of that business association grew the slogan, "Made by
Edison and installed by Barnes."
The business alliance has been in operation for more than thirty years. Out
of it Barnes has made himself rich in money, but he has done something
infinitely greater, he has proved that one really may "Think and Grow Rich."
How much actual cash that original DESIRE of Barnes' has been worth to
him, I have no way of knowing. Perhaps it has brought him two or three million
dollars, but the amount, whatever it is, becomes insignificant when compared
with the greater asset he acquired in the form of definite knowledge that an
intangible impulse of thought can be transmuted into its physical counterpart by the
application of known principles.
Barnes literally thought himself into a partnership with the great Edison!
He thought himself into a fortune. He had nothing to start with, except the
capacity to KNOW WHAT HE WANTED, AND THE DETERMINATION TO
STAND BY THAT DESIRE UNTIL HE REALIZED IT.
He had no money to begin with. He had but little education. He had no
influence. But he did have initiative, faith, and the will to win. With these
intangible forces he made himself number one man with the greatest inventor
who ever lived.
Now, let us look at a different situation, and study a man who had plenty
of tangible evidence of riches, but lost it, because he stopped three feet short of the
goal he was seeking.

THREE FEET FROM GOLD
One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when
one is overtaken by temporary defeat. Every person is guilty of this mistake at one
time or another.

An uncle of R. U. Darby was caught by the "gold fever" in the gold-rush
days, and went west to DIG AND GROW RICH. He had never heard that more
gold has been mined from the brains of men than has ever been taken from the earth. He
staked a claim and went to work with pick and shovel. The going was hard, but
his lust for gold was definite.
After weeks of labor, he was rewarded by the discovery of the shining ore.
He needed machinery to bring the ore to the surface. Quietly, he covered up the
mine, retraced his footsteps to his home in Williamsburg, Maryland, told his
relatives and a few neighbors of the "strike." They got together money for the
needed machinery, had it shipped. The uncle and Darby went back to work the
mine.
The first car of ore was mined, and shipped to a smelter. The returns
proved they had one of the richest mines in Colorado! A few more cars of that
ore would clear the debts. Then would come the big killing in profits.
Down went the drills! Up went the hopes of Darby and Uncle! Then
something happened! The vein of gold ore disappeared! They had come to the
end of the rainbow, and the pot of gold was no longer there! They drilled on,
desperately trying to pick up the vein again— all to no avail.
Finally, they decided to QUIT.
They sold the machinery to a junk man for a few hundred dollars, and
took the train back home. Some "junk" men are dumb, but not this one! He called
in a mining engineer to look at the mine and do a little calculating. The engineer
advised that the project had failed, because the owners were not familiar with
"fault lines." His calculations showed that the vein would be found JUST THREE
FEET FROM WHERE THE DARBYS HAD STOPPED DRILLING! That is exactly
where it was found!
The "Junk" man took millions of dollars in ore from the mine, because he
knew enough to seek expert counsel before giving up.
Most of the money which went into the machinery was procured through
the efforts of R. U. Darby, who was then a very young man. The money came
from his relatives and neighbors, because of their faith in him. He paid back
every dollar of it, although he was years in doing so.
Long afterward, Mr. Darby recouped his loss many times over, when he
made the discovery that DESIRE can be transmuted into gold. The discovery came
after he went into the business of selling life insurance.
Remembering that he lost a huge fortune, because he STOPPED three feet
from gold, Darby profited by the experience in his chosen work, by the simple

method of saying to himself, "I stopped three feet from gold, but I will never stop
because men say 'no' when I ask them to buy insurance."
Darby is one of a small group of fewer than fifty men who sell more than a
million dollars in life insurance annually. He owes his "stickability" to the lesson
he learned from his "quitability" in the gold mining business.
Before success comes in any man's life, he is sure to meet with much
temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the
easiest and most logical thing to do is to QUIT. That is exactly what the majority
of men do.
More than five hundred of the most successful men this country has ever
known, told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point
at which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of
irony and cunning. It takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost
within reach.

A FIFTY-CENT LESSON IN PERSISTENCE
Shortly after Mr. Darby received his degree from the "University of Hard
Knocks," and had decided to profit by his experience in the gold mining
business, he had the good fortune to be present on an occasion that proved to
him that "No" does not necessarily mean no.
One afternoon he was helping his uncle grind wheat in an old fashioned
mill. The uncle operated a large farm on which a number of colored sharecrop
farmers lived. Quietly, the door was opened, and a small colored child, the
daughter of a tenant, walked in and took her place near the door.
The uncle looked up, saw the child, and barked at her roughly, "what do
you want?"
Meekly, the child replied, "My mammy say send her fifty cents."
"I'll not do it," the uncle retorted, "Now you run on home."
"Yas sah," the child replied. But she did not move.
The uncle went ahead with his work, so busily engaged that he did not
pay enough attention to the child to observe that she did not leave. When he
looked up and saw her still standing there, he yelled at her, "I told you to go on
home! Now go, or I'll take a switch to you."
The little girl said "yas sah," but she did not budge an inch.

The uncle dropped a sack of grain he was about to pour into the mill
hopper, picked up a barrel stave, and started toward the child with an expression
on his face that indicated trouble.
Darby held his breath. He was certain he was about to witness a murder.
He knew his uncle had a fierce temper. He knew that colored children were not
supposed to defy white people in that part of the country.
When the uncle reached the spot where the child was standing, she
quickly stepped forward one step, looked up into his eyes, and screamed at the
top of her shrill voice, "MY MAMMY'S GOTTA HAVE THAT FIFTY CENTS!"
The uncle stopped, looked at her for a minute, then slowly laid the barrel
stave on the floor, put his hand in his pocket, took out half a dollar, and gave it to
her.
The child took the money and slowly backed toward the door, never
taking her eyes off the man whom she had just conquered. After she had gone, the
uncle sat down on a box and looked out the window into space for more than ten
minutes. He was pondering, with awe, over the whipping he had just taken.
Mr. Darby, too, was doing some thinking. That was the first time in all his
experience that he had seen a colored child deliberately master an adult white
person. How did she do it? What happened to his uncle that caused him to lose
his fierceness and become as docile as a lamb? What strange power did this child
use that made her master over her superior? These and other similar questions
flashed into Darby's mind, but he did not find the answer until years later, when
he told me the story.
Strangely, the story of this unusual experience was told to the author in
the old mill, on the very spot where the uncle took his whipping. Strangely, too, I
had devoted nearly a quarter of a century to the study of the power which
enabled an ignorant, illiterate colored child to conquer an intelligent man.
As we stood there in that musty old mill, Mr. Darby repeated the story of
the unusual conquest, and finished by asking, "What can you make of it? What
strange power did that child use, that so completely whipped my uncle?"
The answer to his question will be found in the principles described in this
book. The answer is full and complete. It contains details and instructions
sufficient to enable anyone to understand, and apply the same force which the
little child accidentally stumbled upon.
Keep your mind alert, and you will observe exactly what strange power
came to the rescue of the child, you will catch a glimpse of this power in the next
chapter. Somewhere in the book you will find an idea that will quicken your

receptive powers, and place at your command, for your own benefit, this same
irresistible power. The awareness of this power may come to you in the first
chapter, or it may flash into your mind in some subsequent chapter. It may come
in the form of a single idea. Or, it may come in the nature of a plan, or a purpose.
Again, it may cause you to go back into your past experiences of failure or defeat,
and bring to the surface some lesson by which you can regain all that you lost
through defeat.
After I had described to Mr. Darby the power unwittingly used by the
little colored child, he quickly retraced his thirty years of experience as a life
insurance salesman, and frankly acknowledged that his success in that field was
due, in no small degree, to the lesson he had learned from the child.
Mr. Darby pointed out: "every time a prospect tried to bow me out, without
buying, I saw that child standing there in the old mill, her big eyes glaring in
defiance, and I said to myself, 'I've gotta make this sale. ' The better portion of all
sales I have made, were made after people had said 'NO'."
He recalled, too, his mistake in having stopped only three feet from gold,
"but," he said, "that experience was a blessing in disguise. It taught me to keep on
keeping on, no matter how hard the going may be, a lesson I needed to learn
before I could succeed in anything."
This story of Mr. Darby and his uncle, the colored child and the gold
mine, doubtless will be read by hundreds of men who make their living by
selling life insurance, and to all of these, the author wishes to offer the suggestion
that Darby owes to these two experiences his ability to sell more than a million
dollars of life insurance every year.
Life is strange, and often imponderable! Both the successes and the
failures have their roots in simple experiences. Mr. Darby's experiences were
commonplace and simple enough, yet they held the answer to his destiny in life,
therefore they were as important (to him) as life itself. He profited by these two
dramatic experiences, because he analyzed them, and found the lesson they taught.
But what of the man who has neither the time, nor the inclination to study failure
in search of knowledge that may lead to success? Where, and how is he to learn
the art of converting defeat into stepping stones to opportunity?
In answer to these questions, this book was written.
The answer called for a description of thirteen principles, but remember,
as you read, the answer you may be seeking, to the questions which have caused
you to ponder over the strangeness of life, may be found in your own mind,


through some idea, plan, or purpose which may spring into your mind as you
read.
One sound idea is all that one needs to achieve success. The principles
described in this book, contain the best, and the most practical of all that is
known, concerning ways and means of creating useful ideas.
Before we go any further in our approach to the description of these
principles, we believe you are entitled to receive this important suggestion….
WHEN RICHES BEGIN TO COME THEY COME SO QUICKLY, IN SUCH
GREAT ABUNDANCE, THAT ONE WONDERS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN
HIDING DURING ALL THOSE LEAN YEARS. This is an astounding statement,
and all the more so, when we take into consideration the popular belief, that
riches come only to those who work hard and long.
When you begin to THINK AND GROW RICH, you will observe that
riches begin with a state of mind, with definiteness of purpose, with little or no
hard work. You, and every other person, ought to be interested in knowing how
to acquire that state of mind which will attract riches. I spent twenty-five years in
research, analyzing more than 25,000 people, because I, too, wanted to know
"how wealthy men become that way.
Without that research, this book could not have been written.
Here take notice of a very significant truth, viz:
The business depression started in 1929, and continued on to an all time
record of destruction, until sometime after President Roosevelt entered office.
Then the depression began to fade into nothingness. Just as an electrician in a
theatre raises the lights so gradually that darkness is transmuted into light before
you realize it, so did the spell of fear in the minds of the people gradually fade
away and become faith.
Observe very closely, as soon as you master the principles of this
philosophy, and begin to follow the instructions for applying those principles,
your financial status will begin to improve, and everything you touch will begin
to transmute itself into an asset for your benefit. Impossible? Not at all!
One of the main weaknesses of mankind is the average man's familiarity
with the word "impossible." He knows all the rules which will NOT work. He
knows all the things which CANNOT be done. This book was written for those
who seek the rules which have made others successful, and are willing to stake
everything on those rules.


A great many years ago I purchased a fine dictionary. The first thing I did
with it was to turn to the word "impossible," and neatly clip it out of the book.
That would not be an unwise thing for you to do.
Success comes to those who become SUCCESS CONSCIOUS.
Failure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become
FAILURE CONSCIOUS.
The object of this book is to help all who seek it, to learn the art of
changing their minds from FAILURE CONSCIOUSNESS to SUCCESS
CONSCIOUSNESS.
Another weakness found in altogether too many people, is the habit of
measuring everything, and everyone, by their own impressions and beliefs. Some
who will read this, will believe that no one can THINK AND GROW RICH. They
cannot think in terms of riches, because their thought habits have been steeped in
poverty, want, misery, failure, and defeat.
These unfortunate people remind me of a prominent Chinese, who came
to America to be educated in American ways. He attended the University of
Chicago. One day President Harper met this young Oriental on the campus,
stopped to chat with him for a few minutes, and asked what had impressed him
as being the most noticeable characteristic of the American people.
"Why," the Chinaman exclaimed, "the queer slant of your eyes. Your eyes
are off slant!"
What do we say about the Chinese?
We refuse to believe that which we do not understand. We foolishly
believe that our own limitations are the proper measure of limitations. Sure, the
other fellow's eyes are "off slant," BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AS
OUR OWN.
Millions of people look at the achievements of Henry Ford, after he has
arrived, and envy him, because of his good fortune, or luck, or genius, or
whatever it is that they credit for Ford's fortune. Perhaps one person in every
hundred thousand knows the secret of Ford's success, and those who do know
are too modest, or too reluctant, to speak of it, because of its simplicity. A single
transaction will illustrate the "secret" perfectly.
A few years back, Ford decided to produce his now famous V-8 motor. He
chose to build an engine with the entire eight cylinders cast in one block, and
instructed his engineers to produce a design for the engine. The design was
placed on paper, but the engineers agreed, to a man, that it was simply impossible
to cast an eight-cylinder gas engine block in one piece.

Ford said, "Produce it anyway."
"But," they replied, "it's impossible!"
"Go ahead," Ford commanded, "and stay on the job until you succeed no
matter how much time is required."
The engineers went ahead. There was nothing else for them to do, if they
were to remain on the Ford staff. Six months went by, nothing happened.
Another six months passed, and still nothing happened. The engineers tried
every conceivable plan to carry out the orders, but the thing seemed out of the
question; "impossible!"
At the end of the year Ford checked with his engineers, and again they
informed him they had found no way to carry out his orders.
"Go right ahead," said Ford, "I want it, and I'll have it."
They went ahead, and then, as if by a stroke of magic, the secret was
discovered.
The Ford DETERMINATION had won once more!
This story may not be described with minute accuracy, but the sum and
substance of it is correct. Deduce from it, you who wish to THINK AND GROW
RICH, the secret of the Ford millions, if you can. You'll not have to look very far.
Henry Ford is a success, because he understands, and applies the principles
of success. One of these is DESIRE: knowing what one wants. Remember this
Ford story as you read, and pick out the lines in which the secret of his
stupendous achievement have been described. If you can do this, if you can lay
your finger on the particular group of principles which made Henry Ford rich,
you can equal his achievements in almost any calling for which you are suited.
YOU ARE "THE MASTER OF YOUR FATE, THE CAPTAIN OF YOUR
SOUL," BECAUSE…
When Henley wrote the prophetic lines, "I am the Master of my Fate, I am
the Captain of my Soul," he should have informed us that we are the Masters of
our Fate, the Captains of our Souls, because we have the power to control our
thoughts.
He should have told us that the ether in which this little earth floats, in
which we move and have our being, is a form of energy moving at an
inconceivably high rate of vibration, and that the ether is filled with a form of
universal power which ADAPTS itself to the nature of the thoughts we hold in


our minds; and INFLUENCES us, in natural ways, to transmute our thoughts
into their physical equivalent.
If the poet had told us of this great truth, we would know WHY IT IS that
we are the Masters of our Fate, the Captains of our Souls. He should have told
us, with great emphasis, that this power makes no attempt to discriminate
between destructive thoughts and constructive thoughts, that it will urge us to
translate into physical reality thoughts of poverty, just as quickly as it will
influence us to act upon thoughts of riches.
He should have told us, too, that our brains become magnetized with the
dominating thoughts which we hold in our minds, and, by means with which no
man is familiar, these "magnets" attract to us the forces, the people, the
circumstances of life which harmonize with the nature of our dominating
thoughts.
He should have told us, that before we can accumulate riches in great
abundance, we must magnetize our minds with intense DESIRE for riches, that
we must become "money conscious until the DESIRE for money drives us to
create definite plans for acquiring it.
But, being a poet, and not a philosopher, Henley contented himself by
stating a great truth in poetic form, leaving those who followed him to interpret
the philosophical meaning of his lines.
Little by little, the truth has unfolded itself, until it now appears certain
that the principles described in this book, hold the secret of mastery over our
economic fate.
We are now ready to examine the first of these principles. Maintain a
spirit of open-mindedness, and remember as you read, they are the invention of
no one man. The principles were gathered from the life experiences of more than
500 men who actually accumulated riches in huge amounts; men who began in
poverty, with but little education, without influence. The principles worked for
these men. You can put them to work for your own enduring benefit.
You will find it easy, not hard, to do.
Before you read the next chapter, I want you to know that it conveys
factual information which might easily change your entire financial destiny, as it
has so definitely brought changes of stupendous proportions to two people
described.
I want you to know, also, that the relationship between these two men and
myself, is such that I could have taken no liberties with the facts, even if I had
wished to do so. One of them has been my closest personal friend for almost

twenty-five years, the other is my own son. The unusual success of these two
men, success which they generously accredit to the principle described in the
next chapter, more than justifies this personal reference as a means of
emphasizing the far-flung power of this principle.
Almost fifteen years ago, I delivered the Commencement Address at
Salem College, Salem, West Virginia. I emphasized the principle described in the
next chapter, with so much intensity that one of the members of the graduating
class definitely appropriated it, and made it a part of his own philosophy. The
young man is now a Member of Congress, and an important factor in the present
administration. Just before this book went to the publisher, he wrote me a letter
in which he so clearly stated his opinion of the principle outlined in the next
chapter, that I have chosen to publish his letter as an introduction to that chapter.
It gives you an idea of the rewards to come.
"My dear Napoleon:
"My service as a Member of Congress having given me an insight
into the problems of men and women, I am writing to offer a suggestion
which may become helpful to thousands of worthy people.
"With apologies, I must state that the suggestion, if acted upon,
will mean several years of labor and responsibility for you, but I am
enheartened to make the suggestion, because I know your great love for
rendering useful service.
"In 1922, you delivered the Commencement address at Salem
College, when I was a member' of the graduating class. In that address,
you planted in my mind an idea which has been responsible for the
opportunity I now have to serve the people of my State, and will be
responsible, in a very large measure, for whatever success I may have in
the future.
"The suggestion I have in mind is, that you put into a book the
sum and substance of the address you delivered at Salem College, and in
that way give the people of America an opportunity to profit by your
many years of experience and association with the men who, by their
greatness, have made America the richest nation on earth.
"I recall, as though it were yesterday, the marvelous description
you gave of the method by which Henry Ford, with but little schooling,
without a dollar, with no influential friends, rose to great heights. I made
up my mind then, even before you had finished your speech, that I would

make a place for myself, no matter how many difficulties I had to
surmount.
"Thousands of young people will finish their schooling this year,
and within the next few years. Every one of them will be seeking just such
a message of practical encouragement as the one I received from you. They
will want to know where to turn, what to do, to get started in life. You
can tell them, because you have helped to solve the problems of so many,
many people.
"If there is any possible way that you can afford to render so great
a service, may I offer the suggestion that you include with every book, one
of your Personal Analysis Charts, in order that the purchaser of the book
may have the benefit of a complete self-inventory, indicating, as you
indicated to me years ago, exactly what is standing in the way of success.
"Such a service as this, providing the readers of your book with a
complete, unbiased picture of their faults and their virtues, would mean to
them the difference between success and failure. The service would be
priceless.
"Millions of people are now facing the problem of staging a
comeback, because of the depression, and I speak from personal experience
when I say, I know these earnest people would welcome the opportunity to
tell you their problems, and to receive your suggestions for the solution.
"You know the problems of those who face the necessity of
beginning all over again. There are thousands of people in America today
who would like to know how they can convert ideas into money, people
who must start at scratch, without finances, and recoup their losses. If
anyone can help them, you can.
"If you publish the book, I would like to own the first copy that
comes from the press, personally autographed by you.
"With best wishes, believe me,
"Cordially yours,
"JENNINGS RANDOLPH"


CHAPTER 2
DESIRE
THE STARTING POINT OF ALL ACHIEVEMENT
The First Step toward Riches
WHEN Edwin C. Barnes climbed down from the freight train in Orange,
N. J., more than thirty years ago, he may have resembled a tramp, but his
thoughts were those of a king!
As he made his way from the railroad tracks to Thomas A. Edison's office,
his mind was at work. He saw himself standing in Edison's presence. He heard
himself asking Mr. Edison for an opportunity to carry out the one CONSUMING
OBSESSION OF HIS LIFE, a BURNING DESIRE to become the business associate
of the great inventor.
Barnes' desire was not a hope! It was not a wish! It was a keen, pulsating
DESIRE, which transcended everything else. It was DEFINITE.
The desire was not new when he approached Edison. It had been Barnes'
dominating desire for a long time. In the beginning, when the desire first appeared
in his mind, it may have been, probably was, only a wish, but it was no mere
wish when he appeared before Edison with it.
A few years later, Edwin C. Barnes again stood before Edison, in the same
office where he first met the inventor. This time his DESIRE had been translated
into reality. He was in business with Edison. The dominating DREAM OF HIS LIFE
had become a reality. Today, people who know Barnes envy him, because of the
"break" life yielded him. They see him in the days of his triumph, without taking
the trouble to investigate the cause of his success.
Barnes succeeded because he chose a definite goal, placed all his energy,
all his will power, all his effort, everything back of that goal. He did not become
the partner of Edison the day he arrived. He was content to start in the most
menial work, as long as it provided an opportunity to take even one step toward
his cherished goal.
Five years passed before the chance he had been seeking made its
appearance. During all those years not one ray of hope, not one promise of

attainment of his DESIRE had been held out to him. To everyone, except himself,
he appeared only another cog in the Edison business wheel, but in his own mind,
HE WAS THE PARTNER OF EDISON EVERY MINUTE OF THE TIME, from the
very day that he first went to work there.
It is a remarkable illustration of the power of a DEFINITE DESIRE. Barnes
won his goal, because he wanted to be a business associate of Mr. Edison, more
than he wanted anything else. He created a plan by which to attain that purpose.
But he BURNED ALL BRIDGES BEHIND HIM.
He stood by his DESIRE until it became the dominating obsession of his
life— and— finally, a fact.
When he went to Orange, he did not say to himself, "I will try to induce
Edison to give me a job of some soft." He said, "I will see Edison, and put him on
notice that I have come to go into business with him.
He did not say, "I will work there for a few months, and if I get no
encouragement, I will quit and get a job somewhere else." He did say, "I will start
anywhere. I will do anything Edison tells me to do, but before I am through, I will
be his associate."
He did not say, "I will keep my eyes open for another opportunity, in case
I fail to get what I want in the Edison organization." He said, "There is but ONE
thing in this world that I am determined to have, and that is a business
association with Thomas A. Edison. I will burn all bridges behind me, and stake
my ENTIRE FUTURE on my ability to get what I want."
He left himself no possible way of retreat. He had to win or perish!
That is all there is to the Barnes story of success! A long while ago, a great
warrior faced a situation which made it necessary for him to make a decision
which insured his success on the battlefield. He was about to send his armies
against a powerful foe, whose men outnumbered his own. He loaded his soldiers
into boats, sailed to the enemy's country, unloaded soldiers and equipment, then
gave the order to burn the ships that had carried them. Addressing his men
before the first battle, he said, "You see the boats going up in smoke. That means
that we cannot leave these shores alive unless we win! We now have no choice—
we win, or we perish! They won.
Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his
ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of
maintaining that state of mind known as a BURNING DESIRE TO WIN, essential
to success.


The morning after the great Chicago fire, a group of merchants stood on
State Street, looking at the smoking remains of what had been their stores. They
went into a conference to decide if they would try to rebuild, or leave Chicago
and start over in a more promising section of the country. They reached a
decision—all except one—to leave Chicago.
The merchant who decided to stay and rebuild pointed a finger at the
remains of his store, and said, "Gentlemen, on that very spot I will build the
world's greatest store, no matter how many times it may burn down."
That was more than fifty years ago. The store was built. It stands there
today, a towering monument to the power of that state of mind known as a
BURNING DESIRE. The easy thing for Marshal Field to have done, would have
been exactly what his fellow merchants did. When the going was hard, and the
future looked dismal, they pulled up and went where the going seemed easier.
Mark well this difference between Marshal Field and the other merchants,
because it is the same difference which distinguishes Edwin C. Barnes from
thousands of other young men who have worked in the Edison organization. It is
the same difference which distinguishes practically all who succeed from those
who fail.
Every human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose
of money, wishes for it. Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a
state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means
to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not
recognize failure, will bring riches.
The method by which DESIRE for riches can be transmuted into its
financial equivalent, consists of six definite, practical steps, viz:
First. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you
desire. It is not sufficient merely to say "I want plenty of money." Be
definite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for
definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter).
Second. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return
for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as "something
for nothing.)
Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess
the money you desire.

Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire,
and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan
into action.
Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of
money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its
acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money,
and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to
accumulate it.
Sixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once
just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning.
AS YOU READ— SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF
ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.
It is important that you follow the instructions described in these six steps.
It is especially important that you observe, and follow the instructions in the
sixth paragraph. You may complain that it is impossible for you to "see yourself
in possession of money" before you actually have it. Here is where a BURNING
DESIRE will come to your aid. If you truly DESIRE money so keenly that your
desire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you
will acquire it. The object is to want money, and to become so determined to
have it that you CONVINCE yourself you will have it.
Only those who become "money conscious" ever accumulate great riches.
"Money consciousness" means that the mind has become so thoroughly saturated
with the DESIRE for money, that one can see one's self already in possession of it.
To the uninitiated, who has not been schooled in the working principles of
the human mind, these instructions may appear impractical. It may be helpful, to
all who fail to recognize the soundness of the six steps, to know that the
information they convey, was received from Andrew Carnegie, who began as an
ordinary laborer in the steel mills, but managed, despite his humble beginning,
to make these principles yield him a fortune of considerably more than one
hundred million dollars.
It may be of further help to know that the six steps here recommended
were carefully scrutinized by the late Thomas A. Edison, who placed his stamp


of approval upon them as being, not only the steps essential for the accumulation
of money, but neccessary for the attainment of any definite goal.
The steps call for no "hard labor." They call for no sacrifice. They do not
require one to become ridiculous, or credulous. To apply them calls for no great
amount of education. But the successful application of these six steps does call
for sufficient imagination to enable one to see, and to understand, that
accumulation of money cannot be left to chance, good fortune, and luck. One
must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes, first did a certain
amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, DESIRING, and PLANNING before they
acquired money.
You may as well know, right here, that you can never have riches in great
quantities, UNLESS you can work yourself into a white heat of DESIRE for
money, and actually BELIEVE you will possess it.
You may as well know, also that every great leader, from the dawn of
civilization down to the present, was a dreamer. Christianity is the greatest
potential power in the world today, because its founder was an intense dreamer
who had the vision and the imagination to see realities in their mental and
spiritual form before they had been transmuted into physical form.
If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them
in your bank balance.
Never, in the history of America has there been so great an opportunity
for practical dreamers as now exists. The six year economic collapse has reduced
all men, substantially, to the same level. A new race is about to be run. The stakes
represent huge fortunes which will be accumulated within the next ten years.
The rules of the race have changed, because we now live in a CHANGED
WORLD that definitely favors the masses, those who had but little or no
opportunity to win under the conditions existing during the depression, when
fear paralyzed growth and development.
We who are in this race for riches, should be encouraged to know that this
changed world in which we live is demanding new ideas, new ways of doing
things, new leaders, new inventions, new methods of teaching, new methods of
marketing, new books, new literature, new features for the radio, new ideas for
moving pictures. Back of all this demand for new and better things, there is one
quality which one must possess to win, and that is DEFINITENESS OF
PURPOSE, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning DESIRE to possess
it.


The business depression marked the death of one age, and the birth of
another. This changed world requires practical dreamers who can, and will put
their dreams into action. The practical dreamers have always been, and always
will be the pattern-makers of civilization.
We who desire to accumulate riches, should remember the real leaders of
the world always have been men who harnessed, and put into practical use, the
intangible, unseen forces of unborn opportunity, and have converted those
forces, [or impulses of thought], into sky-scrapers, cities, factories, airplanes,
automobiles, and every form of convenience that makes life more pleasant.
Tolerance, and an open mind are practical necessities of the dreamer of
today. Those who are afraid of new ideas are doomed before they start. Never
has there been a time more favorable to pioneers than the present. True, there is
no wild and woolly west to be conquered, as in the days of the Covered Wagon;
but there is a vast business, financial, and industrial world to be remoulded and
redirected along new and better lines.
In planning to acquire your share of the riches, let no one influence you to
scorn the dreamer. To win the big stakes in this changed world, you must catch
the spirit of the great pioneers of the past, whose dreams have given to
civilization all that it has of value, the spirit which serves as the life-blood of our
own country— your opportunity and mine, to develop and market our talents.
Let us not forget, Columbus dreamed of an Unknown world, staked his
life on the existence of such a world, and discovered it!
Copernicus, the great astronomer, dreamed of a multiplicity of worlds,
and revealed them! No one denounced him as "impractical" after he had
triumphed. Instead, the world worshipped at his shrine, thus proving once more
that "SUCCESS REQUIRES NO APOLOGIES, FAILURE PERMITS NO ALIBIS."
If the thing you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it!
Put your dream across, and never mind what "they" say if you meet with
temporary defeat, for "they," perhaps, do not know that EVERY FAILURE
BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT SUCCESS.
Henry Ford, poor and uneducated, dreamed of a horseless carriage, went
to work with what tools he possessed, without waiting for opportunity to favor
him, and now evidence of his dream belts the entire earth. He has put more
wheels into operation than any man who ever lived, because he was not afraid to
back his dreams.
Thomas Edison dreamed of a lamp that could be operated by electricity,
began where he stood to put his dream into action, and despite more than ten

thousand failures, he stood by that dream until he made it a physical reality.
Practical dreamers DO NOT QUIT!
Whelan dreamed of a chain of cigar stores, transformed his dream into
action, and now the United Cigar Stores occupy the best corners in America.
Lincoln dreamed of freedom for the black slaves, put his dream into
action, and barely missed living to see a united North and South translate his
dream into reality.
The Wright brothers dreamed of a machine that would fly through the air.
Now one may see evidence all over the world, that they dreamed soundly.
Marconi dreamed of a system for harnessing the intangible forces of the
ether. Evidence that he did not dream in vain, may be found in every wireless
and radio in the world. Moreover, Marconi's dream brought the humblest cabin,
and the most stately manor house side by side. It made the people of every
nation on earth back-door neighbors. It gave the President of the United States a
medium by which he may talk to all the people of America at one time, and on
short notice. It may interest you to know that Marconi's "friends" had him taken
into custody, and examined in a psychopathic hospital, when he announced he
had discovered a principle through which he could send messages through the
air, without the aid of wires, or other direct physical means of communication.
The dreamers of today fare better.
The world has become accustomed to new discoveries. Nay, it has shown
a willingness to reward the dreamer who gives the world a new idea.
"The greatest achievement was, at first, and for a time, but a dream."
"The oak sleeps in the acorn. The bird waits in the egg, and in the highest
vision of the soul, a waking angel stirs. DREAMS ARE THE SEEDLINGS OF
REALITY."
Awake, arise, and assert yourself, you dreamers of the world. Your star is
now in the ascendency. The world depression brought the opportunity you have
been waiting for. It taught people humility, tolerance, and open-mindedness.
The world is filled with an abundance of OPPORTUNITY which the
dreamers of the past never knew.
A BURNING DESIRE TO BE, AND TO DO is the starting point from
which the dreamer must take off. Dreams are not born of indifference, laziness,
or lack of ambition.
The world no longer scoffs at the dreamer, nor calls him impractical. If
you think it does, take a trip to Tennessee, and witness what a dreamer President


has done in the way of harnessing, and using the great water power of America.
A score of years ago, such a dream would have seemed like madness.
You have been disappointed, you have undergone defeat during the
depression, you have felt the great heart within you crushed until it bled. Take
courage, for these experiences have tempered the spiritual metal of which you
are made—they are assets of incomparable value.
Remember, too, that all who succeed in life get off to a bad start, and pass
through many heartbreaking struggles before they "arrive." The turning point in
the lives of those who succeed, usually comes at the moment of some crisis,
through which they are introduced to their "other selves."
John Bunyan wrote the Pilgrim's Progress, which is among the finest of all
English literature, after he had been confined in prison and sorely punished,
because of his views on the subject of religion.
O. Henry discovered the genius which slept within his brain, after he had
met with great misfortune, and was confined in a prison cell, in Columbus, Ohio.
Being FORCED, through misfortune, to become acquainted with his "other self,"
and to use his IMAGINATION, he discovered himself to be a great author
instead of a miserable criminal and outcast. Strange and varied are the ways of
life, and stranger still are the ways of Infinite Intelligence, through which men
are sometimes forced to undergo all sorts of punishment before discovering their
own brains, and their own capacity to create useful ideas through imagination.
Edison, the world's greatest inventor and scientist, was a "tramp"
telegraph operator, he failed innumerable times before he was driven, finally, to
the discovery of the genius which slept within his brain.
Charles Dickens began by pasting labels on blacking pots. The tragedy of
his first love penetrated the depths of his soul, and converted him into one of the
world's truly great authors. That tragedy produced, first, David Copperfield,
then a succession of other works that made this a richer and better world for all
who read his books. Disappointment over love affairs, generally has the effect of
driving men to drink, and women to ruin; and this, because most people never
learn the art of transmuting their strongest emotions into dreams of a
constructive nature.
Helen Keller became deaf, dumb, and blind shortly after birth. Despite her
greatest misfortune, she has written her name indelibly in the pages of the
history of the great. Her entire life has served as evidence that no one ever is
defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality.


Robert Burns was an illiterate country lad, he was cursed by poverty, and
grew up to be a drunkard in the bargain. The world was made better for his
having lived, because he clothed beautiful thoughts in poetry, and thereby
plucked a thorn and planted a rose in its place.
Booker T. Washington was born in slavery, handicapped by race and
color. Because he was tolerant, had an open mind at all times, on all subjects, and
was a DREAMER, he left his impress for good on an entire race.
Beethoven was deaf, Milton was blind, but their names will last as long as
time endures, because they dreamed and translated their dreams into organized
thought.
Before passing to the next chapter, kindle anew in your mind the fire of
hope, faith, courage, and tolerance. If you have these states of mind, and a
working knowledge of the principles described, all else that you need will come
to you, when you are READY for it. Let Emerson state the thought in these
words, "Every proverb, every book, every byword that belongs to thee for aid
and comfort shall surely come home through open or winding passages. Every
friend whom not thy fantastic will, but the great and tender soul in thee craveth,
shall lock thee in his embrace."
There is a difference between WISHING for a thing and being READY to
receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state
of mind must be BELIEF, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential
for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief.
Remember, no more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand
abundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty. A
great poet has correctly stated this universal truth through these lines:
"I bargained with Life for a penny,
And Life would pay no more,
However I begged at evening
When I counted my scanty store. .
.
"For Life is a.just employer,
He gives you what you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why, you must bear the task.
.
"I worked for a menial's hire,

Only to learn, dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of Life,
Life would have willingly paid."

DESIRE OUTWITS MOTHER NATURE
As a fitting climax to this chapter, I wish to introduce one of the most
unusual persons I have ever known. I first saw him twenty-four years ago, a few
minutes after he was born. He came into the world without any physical sign of
ears, and the doctor admitted, when pressed for an opinion, that the child might
be deaf, and mute for life.
I challenged the doctor's opinion. I had the right to do so, I was the child's
father. I, too, reached a decision, and rendered an opinion, but I expressed the
opinion silently, in the secrecy of my own heart. I decided that my son would
hear and speak. Nature could send me a child without ears, but Nature could not
induce me to accept the reality of the affliction.
In my own mind I knew that my son would hear and speak. How? I was
sure there must be a way, and I knew I would find it. I thought of the words of
the immortal Emerson, "The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. We
need only obey.
There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening, we shall hear the
right word."
The right word? DESIRE! More than anything else, I DESIRED that my
son should not be a deaf mute. From that desire I never receded, not for a second.
Many years previously, I had written, "Our only limitations are those we
set up in our own minds." For the first time, I wondered if that statement were
true. Lying on the bed in front of me was a newly born child, without the natural
equipment of hearing. Even though he might hear and speak, he was obviously
disfigured for life. Surely, this was a limitation which that child had not set up in
his own mind.
What could I do about it? Somehow I would find a way to transplant into
that child's mind my own BURNING DESIRE for ways and means of conveying
sound to his brain without the aid of ears.


As soon as the child was old enough to cooperate, I would fill his mind so
completely with a BURNING DESIRE to hear, that Nature would, by methods of
her own, translate it into physical reality.
All this thinking took place in my own mind, but I spoke of it to no one.
Every day I renewed the pledge I had made to myself, not to accept a deaf mute
for a son.
As he grew older, and began to take notice of things around him, we
observed that he had a slight degree of hearing. When he reached the age when
children usually begin talking, he made no attempt to speak, but we could tell by
his actions that he could hear certain sounds slightly. That was all I wanted to
know! I was convinced that if he could hear, even slightly, he might develop still
greater hearing capacity. Then something happened which gave me hope. It
came from an entirely unexpected source.
We bought a victrola. When the child heard the music for the first time, he
went into ecstasies, and promptly appropriated the machine. He soon showed a
preference for certain records, among them, "It's a Long Way to Tipperary." On
one occasion, he played that piece over and over, for almost two hours, standing
in front of the victrola, with his teeth clamped on the edge of the case. The significance
of this self-formed habit of his did not become clear to us until years afterward,
for we had never heard of the principle of "bone conduction" of sound at that
time.
Shortly after he appropriated the victrola, I discovered that he could hear
me quite clearly when I spoke with my lips touching his mastoid bone, or at the
base of the brain. These discoveries placed in my possession the necessary media
by which I began to translate into reality my Burning Desire to help my son
develop hearing and speech. By that time he was making stabs at speaking
certain words. The outlook was far from encouraging, but DESIRE BACKED BY
FAITH knows no such word as impossible.
Having determined that he could hear the sound of my voice plainly, I
began, immediately, to transfer to his mind the desire to hear and speak. I soon
discovered that the child enjoyed bedtime stories, so I went to work, creating
stories designed to develop in him self-reliance, imagination, and a keen desire to
hear and to be normal.
There was one story in particular, which I emphasized by giving it some
new and dramatic coloring each time it was told. It was designed to plant in his
mind the thought that his affliction was not a liability, but an asset of great value.
Despite the fact that all the philosophy I had examined clearly indicated that

EVERY ADVERSITY BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT
ADVANTAGE, I must confess that I had not the slightest idea how this affliction
could ever become an asset. However, I continued my practice of wrapping that
philosophy in bedtime stories, hoping the time would come when he would find
some plan by which his handicap could be made to serve some useful purpose.
Reason told me plainly, that there was no adequate compensation for the lack of
ears and natural hearing equipment. DESIRE backed by FAITH, pushed reason
aside, and inspired me to carry on.
As I analyze the experience in retrospect, I can see now, that my son's faith
in me had much to do with the astounding results. He did not question anything I
told him. I sold him the idea that he had a distinct advantage over his older
brother, and that this advantage would reflect itself in many ways. For example,
the teachers in school would observe that he had no ears, and, because of this,
they would show him special attention and treat him with extraordinary
kindness. They always did. His mother saw to that, by visiting the teachers and
arranging with them to give the child the extra attention necessary. I sold him the
idea, too, that when he became old enough to sell newspapers, (his older brother
had already become a newspaper merchant), he would have a big advantage
over his brother, for the reason that people would pay him extra money for his
wares, because they could see that he was a bright, industrious boy, despite the
fact he had no ears.
We could notice that, gradually, the child's hearing was improving.
Moreover, he had not the slightest tendency to be self-conscious, because of his
affliction. When he was about seven, he showed the first evidence that our
method of servicing his mind was bearing fruit. For several months he begged
for the privilege of selling newspapers, but his mother would not give her
consent. She was afraid that his deafness made it unsafe for him to go on the
street alone.
Finally, he took matters in his own hands. One afternoon, when he was
left at home with the servants, he climbed through the kitchen window, shinnied
to the ground, and set out on his own. He borrowed six cents in capital from the
neighborhood shoemaker, invested it in papers, sold out, reinvested, and kept
repeating until late in the evening. After balancing his accounts, and paying back
the six cents he had borrowed from his banker, he had a net profit of forty-two
cents. When we got home that night, we found him in bed asleep, with the
money tightly clenched in his hand.


His mother opened his hand, removed the coins, and cried. Of all things!
Crying over her son's first victory seemed so inappropriate. My reaction was the
reverse. I laughed heartily, for I knew that my endeavor to plant in the child's
mind an attitude of faith in himself had been successful.
His mother saw, in his first business venture, a little deaf boy who had
gone out in the streets and risked his life to earn money. I saw a brave, ambitious,
self-reliant little business man whose stock in himself had been increased a
hundred percent, because he had gone into business on his own initiative, and
had won. The transaction pleased me, because I knew that he had given evidence
of a trait of resourcefulness that would go with him all through life. Later events
proved this to be true. When his older brother wanted something, he would lie
down on the floor, kick his feet in the air, cry for it— and get it. When the "little
deaf boy" wanted something, he would plan a way to earn the money, then buy
it for himself. He still follows that plan!
Truly, my own son has taught me that handicaps can be converted into
stepping stones on which one may climb toward some worthy goal, unless they
are accepted as obstacles, and used as alibis.
The little deaf boy went through the grades, high school, and college
without being able to hear his teachers, excepting when they shouted loudly, at
close range. He did not go to a school for the deaf.
WE WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO LEARN THE SIGN LANGUAGE.
We were determined that he should live a normal life, and associate with normal
children, and we stood by that decision, although it cost us many heated debates
with school officials.
While he was in high school, he tried an electrical hearing aid, but it was
of no value to him; due, we believed, to a condition that was disclosed when the
child was six, by Dr. J. Gordon Wilson, of Chicago, when he operated on one side
of the boy's head, and discovered that there was no sign of natural hearing
equipment.
During his last week in college, (eighteen years after the operation),
something happened which marked the most important turning-point of his life.
Through what seemed to be mere chance, he came into possession of another
electrical hearing device, which was sent to him on trial. He was slow about
testing it, due to his disappointment with a similar device. Finally he picked the
instrument up, and more or less carelessly, placed it on his head, hooked up the
battery, and lo! as if by a stroke of magic, his lifelong DESIRE FOR NORMAL
HEARING BECAME A REALITY! For the first time in his life he heard

practically as well as any person with normal hearing. "God moves in mysterious
ways, His wonders to perform."
Overjoyed because of the Changed World which had been brought to him
through his hearing device, he rushed to the telephone, called his mother, and
heard her voice perfectly. The next day he plainly heard the voices of his
professors in class, for the first time in his life! Previously he could hear them
only when they shouted, at short range. He heard the radio. He heard the talking
pictures. For the first time in his life, he could converse freely with other people,
without the necessity of their having to speak loudly. Truly, he had come into
possession of a Changed World. We had refused to accept Nature's error, and, by
PERSISTENT DESIRE, we had induced Nature to correct that error, through the
only practical means available.
DESIRE had commenced to pay dividends, but the victory was not yet
complete. The boy still had to find a definite and practical way to convert his
handicap into an equivalent asset.
Hardly realizing the significance of what had already been accomplished,
but intoxicated with the joy of his newly discovered world of sound, he wrote a
letter to the manufacturer of the hearing-aid, enthusiastically describing his
experience. Something in his letter; something, perhaps which was not written
on the lines, but back of them; caused the company to invite him to New York.
When be arrived, he was escorted through the factory, and while talking with the
Chief Engineer, telling him about his changed world, a hunch, an idea, or an
inspiration— call it what you wish— flashed into his mind. It was this impulse of
thought which converted his affliction into an asset, destined to pay dividends in
both money and happiness to thousands for all time to come.
The sum and substance of that impulse of thought was this: It occurred to
him that he might be of help to the millions of deafened people who go through
life without the benefit of hearing devices, if he could find a way to tell them the
story of his Changed World. Then and there, he reached a decision to devote the
remainder of his life to rendering useful service to the hard of hearing.
For an entire month, he carried on an intensive research, during which he
analyzed the entire marketing system of the manufacturer of the hearing device,
and created ways and means of communicating with the hard of hearing all over
the world for the purpose of sharing with them his newly discovered "Changed
World." When this was done, he put in writing a two-year plan, based upon his
findings. When he presented the plan to the company, he was instantly given a
position, for the purpose of carrying out his ambition.

Little did he dream, when he went to work, that he was destined to bring
hope and practical relief to thousands of deafened people who, without his help,
would have been doomed forever to deaf mutism.
Shortly after he became associated with the manufacturer of his hearing
aid, he invited me to attend a class conducted by his company, for the purpose of
teaching deaf mutes to hear, and to speak. I had never heard of such a form of
education, therefore I visited the class, skeptical but hopeful that my time would
not be entirely wasted. Here I saw a demonstration which gave me a greatly
enlarged vision of what I had done to arouse and keep alive in my son's mind the
DESIRE for normal hearing. I saw deaf mutes actually being taught to hear and
to speak, through application of the self-same principle I had used, more than
twenty years previously, in saving my son from deaf mutism.
Thus, through some strange turn of the Wheel of Fate, my son, Blair, and I
have been destined to aid in correcting deaf mutism for those as yet unborn,
because we are the only living human beings, as far as I know, who have
established definitely the fact that deaf mutism can be corrected to the extent of
restoring to normal life those who suffer with this affliction. It has been done for
one; it will be done for others.
There is no doubt in my mind that Blair would have been a deaf mute all
his life, if his mother and I had not managed to shape his mind as we did. The
doctor who attended at his birth told us, confidentially, the child might never
hear or speak. A few weeks ago, Dr. Irving Voorhees, a noted specialist on such
cases, examined Blair very thoroughly. He was astounded when he learned how
well my son now hears, and speaks, and said his examination indicated that
"theoretically, the boy should not be able to hear at all." But the lad does hear,
despite the fact that X-ray pictures show there is no opening in the skull,
whatsoever, from where his ears should be to the brain.
When I planted in his mind the DESIRE to hear and talk, and live as a
normal person, there went with that impulse some strange influence which
caused Nature to become bridge-builder, and span the gulf of silence between his
brain and the outer world, by some means which the keenest medical specialists
have not been able to interpret. It would be sacrilege for me to even conjecture as
to how Nature performed this miracle. It would be unforgivable if I neglected to
tell the world as much as I know of the humble part I assumed in the strange
experience. It is my duty, and a privilege to say I believe, and not without reason,
that nothing is impossible to the person who backs DESIRE with enduring
FAITH.

Verily, a BURNING DESIRE has devious ways of transmuting itself into
its physical equivalent. Blair DESIRED normal hearing; now he has it! He was
born with a handicap which might easily have sent one with a less defined
DESIRE to the street with a bundle of pencils and a tin cup. That handicap now
promises to serve as the medium by which he will render useful service to many
millions of hard of hearing, also, to give him useful employment at adequate
financial compensation the remainder of his life.
The little "white lies" I planted in his mind when he was a child, by
leading him to BELIEVE his affliction would become a great asset, which he
could capitalize, has justified itself. Verily, there is nothing, right or wrong,
which BELIEF, plus BURNING DESIRE, cannot make real. These qualities are
free to everyone.
In all my experience in dealing with men and women who had personal
problems, I never handled a single case which more definitely demonstrates the
power of DESIRE. Authors sometimes make the mistake of writing of subjects of
which they have but superficial, or very elementary knowledge. It has been my
good fortune to have had the privilege of testing the soundness of the POWER
OF DESIRE, through the affliction of my own son. Perhaps it was providential
that the experience came as it did, for surely no one is better prepared than he, to
serve as an example of what happens when DESIRE is put to the test. If Mother
Nature bends to the will of desire, is it logical that mere men can defeat a burning desire?
Strange and imponderable is the power of the human mind! We do not
understand the method by which it uses every circumstance, every individual,
every physical thing within its reach, as a means of transmuting DESIRE into its
physical counterpart. Perhaps science will uncover this secret.
I planted in my son's mind the DESIRE to hear and to speak as any normal
person hears and speaks. That DESIRE has now become a reality. I planted in his
mind the DESIRE to convert his greatest handicap into his greatest asset. That
DESIRE has been realized. The modus operandi by which this astounding result
was achieved is not hard to describe. It consisted of three very definite facts; first,
I MIXED FAITH with the DESIRE for normal hearing, which I passed on to my
son. Second, I communicated my desire to him in every conceivable way
available, through persistent, continuous effort, over a period of years. Third, HE
BELIEVED ME!
As this chapter was being completed, news came of the death of Mme.
Schuman-Heink. One short paragraph in the news dispatch gives the clue to this


unusual woman's stupendous success as a singer. I quote the paragraph, because
the clue it contains is none other than DESIRE.
Early in her career, Mme. Schuman-Heink visited the director of the
Vienna Court Opera, to have him test her voice. But, he did not test it. After
taking one look at the awkward and poorly dressed girl, he exclaimed, none too
gently, "With such a face, and with no personality at all, how can you ever expect
to succeed in opera? My good child, give up the idea. Buy a sewing machine, and
go to work. YOU CAN NEVER BE A SINGER."
Never is a long time! The director of the Vienna Court Opera knew much
about the technique of singing. He knew little about the power of desire, when it
assumes the proportion of an obsession. If he had known more of that power, he
would not have made the mistake of condemning genius without giving it an
opportunity.
Several years ago, one of my business associates became ill. He became
worse as time went on, and finally was taken to the hospital for an operation.
Just before he was wheeled into the operating room, I took a look at him, and
wondered how anyone as thin and emaciated as he, could possibly go through a
major operation successfully. The doctor warned me that there was little if any
chance of my ever seeing him alive again. But that was the DOCTOR'S
OPINION. It was not the opinion of the patient. Just before he was wheeled
away, he whispered feebly, "Do not be disturbed, Chief, I will be out of here in a
few days." The attending nurse looked at me with pity. But the patient did come
through safely. After it was all over, his physician said, "Nothing but his own
desire to live saved him. He never would have pulled through if he had not
refused to accept the possibility of death."
I believe in the power of DESIRE backed by FAITH, because I have seen
this power lift men from lowly beginnings to places of power and wealth; I have
seen it rob the grave of its victims; I have seen it serve as the medium by which
men staged a comeback after having been defeated in a hundred different ways; I
have seen it provide my own son with a normal, happy, successful life, despite
Nature's having sent him into the world without ears.
How can one harness and use the power of DESIRE? This has been
answered through this, and the subsequent chapters of this book. This message is
going out to the world at the end of the longest, and perhaps, the most
devastating depression America has ever known. It is reasonable to presume that
the message may come to the attention of many who have been wounded by the
depression, those who have lost their fortunes, others who have lost their

positions, and great numbers who must reorganize their plans and stage a
comeback. To all these I wish to convey the thought that all achievement, no
matter what may be its nature, or its purpose, must begin with an intense,
BURNING DESIRE for something definite.
Through some strange and powerful principle of "mental chemistry"
which she has never divulged, Nature wraps up in the impulse of STRONG
DESIRE "that something" which recognizes no such word as impossible, and
accepts no such reality as failure.


CHAPTER 3
FAITH
VISUALIZATION OF, AND
BELIEF IN ATTAINMENT OF
DESIRE
The Second Step toward Riches
FAITH is the head chemist of the mind. When FAITH is blended with the
vibration of thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration,
translates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Infinite Intelligence,
as in the case of prayer.
The emotions of FAITH, LOVE, and SEX are the most powerful of all the
major positive emotions. When the three are blended, they have the effect of
"coloring" the vibration of thought in such a way that it instantly reaches the
subconscious mind, where it is changed into its spiritual equivalent, the only
form that induces a response from Infinite Intelligence.
Love and faith are psychic; related to the spiritual side of man. Sex is
purely biological, and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of
these three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication
between the finite, thinking mind of man, and Infinite Intelligence.
How To Develop Faith
There comes, now, a statement which will give a better understanding of
the importance the principle of auto-suggestion assumes in the transmutation of
desire into its physical, or monetary equivalent; namely: FAITH is a state of mind
which may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the
subconscious mind, through the principle of auto-suggestion.
As an illustration, consider the purpose for which you are, presumably,
reading this book. The object is, naturally, to acquire the ability to transmute the
intangible thought impulse of DESIRE into its physical counterpart, money. By
following the instructions laid down in the chapters on auto-suggestion, and the

subconscious mind, as summarized in the chapter on auto-suggestion, you may
CONVINCE the subconscious mind that you believe you will receive that for
which you ask, and it will act upon that belief, which your subconscious mind
passes back to you in the form of "FAITH," followed by definite plans for
procuring that which you desire.
The method by which one develops FAITH, where it does not already
exist, is extremely difficult to describe, almost as difficult, in fact, as it would be
to describe the color of red to a blind man who has never seen color, and has
nothing with which to compare what you describe to him. Faith is a state of mind
which you may develop at will, after you have mastered the thirteen principles,
because it is a state of mind which develops voluntarily, through application and
use of these principles.
Repetition of affirmation of orders to your subconscious mind is the only known
method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith.
Perhaps the meaning may be made clearer through the following
explanation as to the way men sometimes become criminals. Stated in the words
of a famous criminologist, "When men first come into contact with crime, they
abhor it. If they remain in contact with crime for a time, they become accustomed
to it, and endure it. If they remain in contact with it long enough, they finally
embrace it, and become influenced by it."
This is the equivalent of saying that any impulse of thought which is
repeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted
upon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its
physical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available.
In connection with this, consider again the statement, ALL THOUGHTS
WHICH HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED, (given feeling) AND MIXED WITH
FAITH, begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent
or counterpart.
The emotions, or the "feeling" portion of thoughts, are the factors which
give thoughts vitality, life, and action. The emotions of Faith, Love, and Sex,
when mixed with any thought impulse, give it greater action than any of these
emotions can do singly.
Not only thought impulses which have been mixed with FAITH, but those
which have been mixed with any of the positive emotions, or any of the negative
emotions, may reach, and influence the subconscious mind.
From this statement, you will understand that the subconscious mind will
translate into its physical equivalent, a thought impulse of a negative or

destructive nature, just as readily as it will act upon thought impulses of a
positive or constructive nature. This accounts for the strange phenomenon which
so many millions of people experience, referred to as "misfortune," or "bad luck."
There are millions of people who BELIEVE themselves "doomed" to
poverty and failure, because of some strange force over which they BELIEVE
they have no control. They are the creators of their own "misfortunes," because of
this negative BELIEF, which is picked up by the subconscious mind, and
translated into its physical equivalent.
This is an appropriate place at which to suggest again that you may
benefit, by passing on to your subconscious mind, any DESIRE which you wish
translated into its physical, or monetary equivalent, in a state of expectancy or
BELIEF that the transmutation will actually take place. Your BELIEF, or FAITH,
is the element which determines the action of your subconscious mind. There is
nothing to hinder you from "deceiving" your subconscious mind when giving it
instructions through autosuggestion, as I deceived my son's subconscious mind.
To make this "deceit" more realistic, conduct yourself just as you would, if
you were ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MATERIAL THING WHICH
YOU ARE DEMANDING, when you call upon your subconscious mind.
The subconscious mind will transmute into its physical equivalent, by the
most direct and practical media available, any order which is given to it in a state
of BELIEF, or FAITH that the order will be carried out.
Surely, enough has been stated to give a starting point from which one
may, through experiment and practice, acquire the ability to mix FAITH with
any order given to the subconscious mind. Perfection will come through practice.
It cannot come by merely reading instructions.
If it be true that one may become a criminal by association with crime,
(and this is a known fact), it is equally true that one may develop faith by
voluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith. The mind
comes, finally, to take on the nature of the influences which dominate it.
Understand this truth, and you will know why it is essential for you to
encourage the positive emotions as dominating forces of your mind, and
discourage — and eliminate negative emotions.
A mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for
the state of mind known as faith. A mind so dominated may, at will, give the
subconscious mind instructions, which it will accept and act upon immediately.


FAITH IS A STATE OF MIND WHICH MAY BE
INDUCED BY AUTO-SUGGESTION
All down the ages, the religionists have admonished struggling humanity
to "have faith" in this, that, and the other dogma or creed, but they have failed to
tell people HOW to have faith. They have not stated that "faith is a state of mind,
and that it may be induced by self-suggestion."
In language which any normal human being can understand, we will
describe all that is known about the principle through which FAITH may be
developed, where it does not already exist.
Have Faith in yourself; Faith in the Infinite.
Before we begin, you should be reminded again that:
FAITH is the "eternal elixir" which gives life, power, and action to the
impulse of thought!
The foregoing sentence is worth reading a second time, and a third, and a
fourth. It is worth reading aloud!
FAITH is the starting point of all accumulation of riches!
FAITH is the basis of all "miracles," and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed
by the rules of science!
FAITH is the only known antidote for FAILURE!
FAITH is the element, the "chemical" which, when mixed with prayer,
gives one direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.
FAITH is the element which transforms the ordinary vibration of thought,
created by the finite mind of man, into the spiritual equivalent.
FAITH is the only agency through which the cosmic force of Infinite
Intelligence can be harnessed and used by man.
EVERY ONE OF THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS IS CAPABLE OF
PROOF!
The proof is simple and easily demonstrated. It is wrapped up in the
principle of auto-suggestion. Let us center our attention, therefore, upon the
subject of self-suggestion, and find out what it is, and what it is capable of
achieving.
It is a well known fact that one comes, finally, to BELIEVE whatever one
repeats to one's self, whether the statement be true or false. If a man repeats a lie over
and over, he will eventually accept the lie as truth. Moreover, he will BELIEVE it
to be the truth.


Every man is what he is, because of the DOMINATING THOUGHTS
which he permits to occupy his mind. Thoughts which a man deliberately places
in his own mind, and encourages with sympathy, and with which he mixes any
one or more of the emotions, constitute the motivating forces, which direct and
control his every movement, act, and deed!
Comes, now, a very significant statement of truth:
THOUGHTS WHICH ARE MIXED WITH ANY OF THE FEELINGS OF
EMOTIONS, CONSTITUTE A "MAGNETIC" FORCE WHICH ATTRACTS,
FROM THE VIBRATIONS OF THE ETHER, OTHER SIMILAR, OR RELATED
THOUGHTS. A thought thus "magnetized" with emotion may be compared to a
seed which, when planted in fertile soil, germinates, grows, and multiplies itself
over and over again, until that which was originally one small seed, becomes
countless millions of seeds of the SAME BRAND!
The ether is a great cosmic mass of eternal forces of vibration. It is made
up of both destructive vibrations and constructive vibrations. It carries, at all
times, vibrations of fear, poverty, disease, failure, misery; and vibrations of
prosperity, health, success, and happiness, just as surely as it carries the sound of
hundreds of orchestrations of music, and hundreds of human voices, all of which
maintain their own individuality, and means of identification, through the
medium of radio.
From the great storehouse of the ether, the human mind is constantly
attracting vibrations which harmonize with that which DOMINATES the human
mind. Any thought, idea, plan, or purpose which one holds in one's mind attracts,
from the vibrations of the ether, a host of its relatives, adds these "relatives" to its
own force, and grows until it becomes the dominating, MOTIVATING MASTER
of the individual in whose mind it has been housed.
Now, let us go back to the starting point, and become informed as to how
the original seed of an idea, plan, or purpose may be planted in the mind. The
information is easily conveyed: any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the
mind through repetition of thought. This is why you are asked to write out a
statement of your major purpose, or Definite Chief Aim, commit it to memory,
and repeat it, in audible words, day after day, until these vibrations of sound
have reached your subconscious mind.
We are what we are, because of the vibrations of thought which we pick
up and register, through the stimuli of our daily environment.
Resolve to throw off the influences of any unfortunate environment, and
to build your own life to ORDER. Taking inventory of mental assets and

liabilities, you will discover that your greatest weakness is lack of selfconfidence. This handicap can be surmounted, and timidity translated into
courage, through the aid of the principle of autosuggestion. The application of
this principle may be made through a simple arrangement of positive thought
impulses stated in writing, memorized, and repeated, until they become a part of
the working equipment of the subconscious faculty of your mind.
SELF-CONFIDENCE FORMULA
First. I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of
my Definite Purpose in life, therefore, I DEMAND of myself
persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and
now promise to render such action.
Second. I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will
eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and
gradually transform themselves into physical reality, therefore, I
will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily, upon the
task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating
in my mind a clear mental picture of that person.
Third. I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any
desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek
expression through some practical means of attaining the object
back of it, therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding
of myself the development of SELF-CONFIDENCE.
Fourth. I have clearly written down a description of my
DEFINITE CHIEF AIM in life, and I will never stop trying, until I
shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.
Fifth. I fully realize that no wealth or position can long
endure, unless built upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage
in no transaction which does not benefit all whom it affects. I will
succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the
cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me,
because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred,

envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all
humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others
can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me,
because I will believe in them, and in myself.
I will sign my name to this formula, commit it to memory,
and repeat it aloud once a day, with full FAITH that it will
gradually influence my THOUGHTS and ACTIONS so that I will
become a self-reliant, and successful person.
Back of this formula is a law of Nature which no man has yet been able to
explain. It has baffled the scientists of all ages. The psychologists have named
this law "auto-suggestion," and let it go at that.
The name by which one calls this law is of little importance. The
important fact about it is— it WORKS for the glory and success of mankind, IF it
is used constructively. On the other hand, if used destructively, it will destroy
just as readily. In this statement may be found a very significant truth, namely;
that those who go down in defeat, and end their lives in poverty, misery, and
distress, do so because of negative application of the principle of autosuggestion. The cause may be found in the fact that ALL IMPULSES OF
THOUGHT HAVE A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE THEMSELVES IN THEIR
PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT.
The subconscious mind, (the chemical laboratory in which all thought
impulses are combined, and made ready for translation into physical reality),
makes no distinction between constructive and destructive thought impulses. It
works with the material we feed it, through our thought impulses. The
subconscious mind will translate into reality a thought driven by FEAR just as
readily as it will translate into reality a thought driven by COURAGE, or FAITH.
The pages of medical history are rich with illustrations of cases of
"suggestive suicide." A man may commit suicide through negative suggestion,
just as effectively as by any other means. In a midwestern city, a man by the
name of Joseph Grant, a bank official, "borrowed" a large sum of the bank's
money, without the consent of the directors. He lost the money through
gambling. One afternoon, the Bank Examiner came and began to check the
accounts. Grant left the bank, took a room in a local hotel, and when they found
him, three days later, he was lying in bed, wailing and moaning, repeating over
and over these words, "My God, this will kill me! I cannot stand the disgrace." In


a short time he was dead. The doctors pronounced the case one of "mental
suicide."
Just as electricity will turn the wheels of industry, and render useful
service if used constructively; or snuff out life if wrongly used, so will the law of
auto-suggestion lead you to peace and prosperity, or down into the valley of
misery, failure, and death, according to your degree of understanding and
application of it.
If you fill your mind with FEAR, doubt and unbelief in your ability to
connect with, and use the forces of Infinite Intelligence, the law of auto—
suggestion will take this spirit of unbelief and use it as a pattern by which your
subconscious mind will translate it into its physical equivalent.
THIS STATEMENT IS AS TRUE AS THE STATEMENT THAT TWO AND
TWO ARE FOUR!
Like the wind which carries one ship East, and another West, the law of
auto-suggestion will lift you up or pull you down, according to the way you set
your sails of THOUGHT. The law of auto-suggestion, through which any person
may rise to altitudes of achievement which stagger the imagination, is well
described in the following verse:
"If you think you are beaten, you are,
If you think you dare not, you don't
If you like to win, but you think you can't,
It is almost certain you won't.
.
"If you think you'll lose, you're lost
For out of the world we find,
Success begins with a fellow's will—
It's all in the state of mind.
.
"If you think you are outclassed, you are,
You've got to think high to rise,
You've got to be sure of yourself before
You can ever win a prize.
.
"Life's battles don't always go
To the stronger or faster man,


But soon or late the man who wins
Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!"
Observe the words which have been emphasized, and you will catch the
deep meaning which the poet had in mind.
Somewhere in your make-up (perhaps in the cells of your brain) there lies
sleeping, the seed of achievement which, if aroused and put into action, would
carry you to heights, such as you may never have hoped to attain.
Just as a master musician may cause the most beautiful strains of music to
pour forth from the strings of a violin, so may you arouse the genius which lies
asleep in your brain, and cause it to drive you upward to whatever goal you may
wish to achieve.
Abraham Lincoln was a failure at everything he tried, until he was well
past the age of forty. He was a Mr. Nobody from Nowhere, until a great
experience came into his life, aroused the sleeping genius within his heart and
brain, and gave the world one of its really great men. That "experience" was
mixed with the emotions of sorrow and LOVE. It came to him through Anne
Rutledge, the only woman whom he ever truly loved.
It is a known fact that the emotion of LOVE is closely akin to the state of
mind known as FAITH, and this for the reason that Love comes very near to
translating one's thought impulses into their spiritual equivalent. During his
work of research, the author discovered, from the analysis of the life-work and
achievements of hundreds of men of outstanding accomplishment, that there
was the influence of a woman's love back of nearly EVERY ONE OF THEM. The
emotion of love, in the human heart and brain, creates a favorable field of
magnetic attraction, which causes an influx of the higher and finer vibrations
which are afloat in the ether.
If you wish evidence of the power of FAITH, study the achievements of
men and women who have employed it. At the head of the list comes the
Nazarene. Christianity is the greatest single force which influences the minds of
men. The basis of Christianity is FAITH, no matter how many people may have
perverted, or misinterpreted the meaning of this great force, and no matter how
many dogmas and creeds have been created in its name, which do not reflect its
tenets.
The sum and substance of the teachings and the achievements of Christ,
which may have been interpreted as "miracles," were nothing more nor less than
FAITH. If there are any such phenomena as "miracles" they are produced only

through the state of mind known as FAITH! Some teachers of religion, and many
who call themselves Christians, neither understand nor practice FAITH.
Let us consider the power of FAITH, as it is now being demonstrated, by a
man who is well known to all of civilization, Mahatma Gandhi, of India. In this
man the world has one of the most astounding examples known to civilization,
of the possibilities of FAITH. Gandhi wields more potential power than any man
living at this time, and this, despite the fact that he has none of the orthodox tools
of power, such as money, battle ships, soldiers, and materials of warfare. Gandhi
has no money, he has no home, he does not own a suit of clothes, but HE DOES
HAVE POWER. How does he come by that power?
HE CREATED IT OUT OF HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLE
OF FAITH, AND THROUGH HIS ABILITY TO TRANSPLANT THAT FAITH
INTO THE MINDS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE.
Gandhi has accomplished, through the influence of FAITH, that which the
strongest military power on earth could not, and never will accomplish through
soldiers and military equipment. He has accomplished the astounding feat of
INFLUENCING two hundred million minds to COALESCE AND MOVE IN
UNISON, AS A SINGLE MIND.
What other force on earth, except FAITH could do as much?
There will come a day when employees as well as employers will discover
the possibilities of FAITH. That day is dawning. The whole world has had ample
opportunity, during the recent business depression, to witness what the LACK
OF FAITH will do to business.
Surely, civilization has produced a sufficient number of intelligent human
beings to make use of this great lesson which the depression has taught the
world. During this depression, the world had evidence in abundance that
widespread FEAR will paralyze the wheels of industry and business. Out of this
experience will arise leaders in business and industry who will profit by the
example which Gandhi has set for the world, and they will apply to business the
same tactics which he has used in building the greatest following known in the
history of the world. These leaders will come from the rank and file of the
unknown men, who now labor in the steel plants, the coal mines, the automobile
factories, and in the small towns and cities of America.
Business is due for a reform, make no mistake about this! The methods of
the past, based upon economic combinations of FORCE and FEAR, will be
supplanted by the better principles of FAITH and cooperation. Men who labor
will receive more than daily wages; they will receive dividends from the

business, the same as those who supply the capital for business; but, first they
must GIVE MORE TO THEIR EMPLOYERS, and stop this bickering and
bargaining by force, at the expense of the public. They must earn the right to
dividends!
Moreover, and this is the most important thing of all— THEY WILL BE
LED BY LEADERS WHO WILL UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE PRINCIPLES
EMPLOYED BY MAHATMA GANDHI. Only in this way may leaders get from
their followers the spirit of FULL cooperation which constitutes power in its
highest and most enduring form.
This stupendous machine age in which we live, and from which we are
just emerging, has taken the soul out of men. Its leaders have driven men as
though they were pieces of cold machinery; they were forced to do so by the
employees who have bargained, at the expense of all concerned, to get and not to
give. The watchword of the future will be HUMAN HAPPINESS AND
CONTENTMENT, and when this state of mind shall have been attained, the
production will take care of itself, more effectively than anything that has ever
been accomplished where men did not, and could not mix FAITH and individual
interest with their labor.
Because of the need for faith and cooperation in operating business and
industry, it will be both interesting and profitable to analyze an event which
provides an excellent understanding of the method by which industrialists and
business men accumulate great fortunes, by giving before they try to get.
The event chosen for this illustration dates back to 1900, when the United
States Steel Corporation was being formed. As you read the story, keep in mind
these fundamental facts and you will understand how IDEAS have been
converted into huge fortunes.
First, the huge United States Steel Corporation was born in the mind of
Charles M. Schwab, in the form of an IDEA he created through his
IMAGINATION! Second, he mixed FAITH with his IDEA. Third, he formulated
a PLAN for the transformation of his IDEA into physical and financial reality.
Fourth, he put his plan into action with his famous speech at the University Club.
Fifth, he applied, and followed-through on his PLAN with PERSISTENCE, and
backed it with firm DECISION until it had been fully carried out. Sixth, he
prepared the way for success by a BURNING DESIRE for success.
If you are one of those who have often wondered how great fortunes are
accumulated, this story of the creation of the United States Steel Corporation will
be enlightening. If you have any doubt that men can THINK AND GROW RICH,

this story should dispel that doubt, because you can plainly see in the story of the
United States Steel, the application of a major portion of the thirteen principles
described in this book.
This astounding description of the power of an IDEA was dramatically
told by John Lowell, in the New York World- Telegram, with whose courtesy it is
here reprinted.
"A PRETTY AFTER-DINNER SPEECH FOR A
BILLION DOLLARS
"When, on the evening of December 12, 1900, some eighty of the nation's
financial nobility gathered in the banquet hail of the University Club on Fifth
Avenue to do honor to a young man from out of the West, not half a dozen of the
guests realized they were to witness the most significant episode in American
industrial history.
"J. Edward Simmons and Charles Stewart Smith, their hearts full of
gratitude for the lavish hospitality bestowed on them by Charles M. Schwab
during a recent visit to Pittsburgh, had arranged the dinner to introduce the
thirty-eight-year-old steel man to eastern banking society. But they didn't expect
him to stampede the convention. They warned him, in fact, that the bosoms
within New York's stuffed shirts would not be responsive to oratory, and that, if
he didn't want to bore the Stilhnans and Harrimans and Vanderbilts, he had
better limit himself to fifteen or twenty minutes of polite vaporings and let it go
at that.
"Even John Pierpont Morgan, sitting on the right hand of Schwab as
became his imperial dignity, intended to grace the banquet table with his
presence only briefly. And so far as the press and public were concerned, the
whole affair was of so little moment that no mention of it found its way into print
the next day.
"So the two hosts and their distinguished guests ate their way through the
usual seven or eight courses. There was little conversation and what there was of
it was restrained. Few of the bankers and brokers had met Schwab, whose career
had flowered along the banks of the Monongahela, and none knew him well. But
before the evening was over, they— and with them Money Master Morgan —
were to be swept off their feet, and a billion dollar baby, the United States Steel
Corporation, was to be conceived.


"It is perhaps unfortunate, for the sake of history, that no record of Charlie
Schwab's speech at the dinner ever was made. He repeated some parts of it at a
later date during a similar meeting of Chicago bankers. And still later, when the
Government brought suit to dissolve the Steel Trust, he gave his own version,
from the witness stand, of the remarks that stimulated Morgan into a frenzy of
financial activity.
"It is probable, however, that it was a 'homely' speech, somewhat
ungrammatical (for the niceties of language never bothered Schwab), full of
epigram and threaded with wit. But aside from that it had a galvanic force and
effect upon the five billions of estimated capital that was represented by the
diners. After it was over and the gathering was still under its spell, although
Schwab had talked for ninety minutes, Morgan led the orator to a recessed
window where, dangling their legs from the high, uncomfortable seat, they
talked for an hour more.
"The magic of the Schwab personality had been turned on, full force, but
what was more important and lasting was the full-fledged, clear-cut program he
laid down for the aggrandizement of Steel. Many other men had tried to interest
Morgan in slapping together a steel trust after the pattern of the biscuit, wire and
hoop, sugar, rubber, whisky, oil or chewing gum combinations. John W. Gates,
the gambler, had urged it, but Morgan distrusted him. The Moore boys, Bill and
Jim, Chicago stock jobbers who had glued together a match trust and a cracker
corporation, had urged it and failed. Elbert H. Gary, the sanctimonious country
lawyer, wanted to foster it, but he wasn't big enough to be impressive. Until
Schwab's eloquence took J. P. Morgan to the heights from which he could
visualize the solid results of the most daring financial undertaking ever
conceived, the project was regarded as a delirious dream of easy-money
crackpots.
"The financial magnetism that began, a generation ago, to attract
thousands of small and sometimes inefficiently managed companies into large
and competition-crushing combinations, had become operative in the steel world
through the devices of that jovial business pirate, John W. Gates. Gates already
had formed the American Steel and Wire Company out of a chain of small
concerns, and together with Morgan had created the Federal Steel Company. The
National Tube and American Bridge companies were two more Morgan
concerns, and the Moore Brothers had forsaken the match and cookie business to
form the 'American' group— Tin Plate, Steel Hoop, Sheet Steel— and the
National Steel Company.

"But by the side of Andrew Carnegie's gigantic vertical trust, a trust
owned and operated by fifty-three partners, those other combinations were
picayune. They might combine to their heart's content but the whole lot of them
couldn't make a dent in the Carnegie organization, and Morgan knew it.
"The eccentric old Scot knew it, too. From the magnificent heights of Skibo
Castle he had viewed, first with amusement and then with resentment, the
attempts of Morgan's smaller companies to cut into his business. When the
attempts became too bold, Carnegie's temper was translated into anger and
retaliation. He decided to duplicate every mill owned by his rivals. Hitherto, he
hadn't been interested in wire, pipe, hoops, or sheet. Instead, he was content to
sell such companies the raw steel and let them work it into whatever shape they
wanted. Now, with Schwab as his chief and able lieutenant, he planned to drive
his enemies to the wall.
"So it was that in the speech of Charles M. Schwab, Morgan saw the
answer to his problem of combination. A trust without Carnegie—giant of them
all—would be no trust at all, a plum pudding, as one writer said, without the
plums.
"Schwab's speech on the night of December 12, 1900, undoubtedly carried
the inference, though not the pledge, that the vast Carnegie enterprise could be
brought under the Morgan tent. He talked of the world future for steel, of
reorganization for efficiency, of specialization, of the scrapping of unsuccessful
mills and concentration of effort on the flourishing properties, of economies in
the ore traffic, of economies in overhead and administrative departments, of
capturing foreign markets.
"More than that, he told the buccaneers among them wherein lay the
errors of their customary piracy. Their purposes, he inferred, bad been to create
monopolies, raise prices, and pay themselves fat dividends out of privilege.
Schwab condemned the system in his heartiest manner. The shortsightedness of
such a policy, he told his hearers, lay in the fact that it restricted the market in an
era when everything cried for expansion. By cheapening the cost of steel, he
argued, an ever-expanding market would be created; more uses for steel would
be devised, and a goodly portion of the world trade could be captured. Actually,
though he did not know it, Schwab was an apostle of modern mass production.
"So the dinner at the University Club came to an end. Morgan went home,
to think about Schwab's rosy predictions. Schwab went back to Pittsburgh to run
the steel business for 'Wee Andra Carnegie,' while Gary and the rest went back to
their stock tickers, to fiddle around in anticipation of the next move.

"It was not long coming. It took Morgan about one week to digest the feast
of reason Schwab had placed before him. When he had assured himself that no
financial indigestion was to result, he sent for Schwab—and found that young
man rather coy. Mr. Carnegie, Schwab indicated, might not like it if he found his
trusted company president had been flirting with the Emperor of Wall Street, the
Street upon which Carnegie was resolved never to tread. Then it was suggested
by John W. Gates the go-between, that if Schwab 'happened' to be in the Bellevue
Hotel in Philadelphia, J. P. Morgan might also 'happen' to be there. When
Schwab arrived, however, Morgan was inconveniently ill at his New York home,
and so, on the elder man's pressing invitation, Schwab went to New York and
presented himself at the door of the financier's library.
"Now certain economic historians have professed the belief that from the
beginning to the end of the drama, the stage was set by Andrew Carnegie— that
the dinner to Schwab, the famous speech, the Sunday night conference between
Schwab and the Money King, were events arranged by the canny Scot. The truth
is exactly the opposite. When Schwab was called in to consummate the deal, he
didn't even know whether 'the little boss, ' as Andrew was called, would so
much as listen to an offer to sell, particularly to a group of men whom Andrew
regarded as being endowed with something less than holiness. But Schwab did
take into the conference with him, in his own handwriting, six sheets of copperplate figures, representing to his mind the physical worth and the potential
earning capacity of every steel company he regarded as an essential star in the
new metal firmament.
"Four men pondered over these figures all night. The chief, of course, was
Morgan, steadfast in his belief in the Divine Right of Money. With him was his
aristocratic partner, Robert Bacon, a scholar and a gentleman. The third was John
W. Gates whom Morgan scorned as a gambler and used as a tool. The fourth was
Schwab, who knew more about the processes of making and selling steel than
any whole group of men then living. Throughout that conference, the
Pittsburgher's figures were never questioned. If he said a company was worth so
much, then it was worth that much and no more. He was insistent, too, upon
including in the combination only those concerns he nominated. He had
conceived a corporation in which there would be no duplication, not even to
satisfy the greed of friends who wanted to unload their companies upon the
broad Morgan shoulders. Thus he left out, by design, a number of the larger
concerns upon which the Walruses and Carpenters of Wall Street had cast
hungry eyes.

"When dawn came, Morgan rose and straightened his back. Only one
question remained.
"' Do you think you can persuade Andrew Carnegie to sell? ' he asked.
"' I can try, ' said Schwab.
"' If you can get him to sell, I will undertake the matter, ' said Morgan.
"So far so good. But would Carnegie sell? How much would he demand?
(Schwab thought about $320,000,000). What would he take payment in? Common
or preferred stocks? Bonds? Cash? Nobody could raise a third of a billion dollars
in cash.
"There was a golf game in January on the frost-cracking heath of the St.
Andrews links in Westchester, with Andrew bundled up in sweaters against the
cold, and Charlie talking volubly, as usual, to keep his spirits up. But no word of
business was mentioned until the pair sat down in the cozy warmth of the
Carnegie cottage hard by. Then, with the same persuasiveness that had
hypnotized eighty millionaires at the University Club, Schwab poured out the
glittering promises of retirement in comfort, of untold millions to satisfy the old
man's social caprices. Carnegie capitulated, wrote a figure on a slip of paper,
handed it to Schwab and said, 'all right, that's what we'll sell for.'
"The figure was approximately $400,000,000, and was reached by taking
the $320,000,000 mentioned by Schwab as a basic figure, and adding to it
$80,000,000 to represent the increased capital value over the previous two years.
"Later, on the deck of a trans-Atlantic liner, the Scotsman said ruefully to
Morgan, 'I wish I had asked you for $100,000,000 more.'
"' If you had asked for it, you'd have gotten it, ' Morgan told him
cheerfully.
***************
"There was an uproar, of course. A British correspondent cabled that the
foreign steel world was 'appalled' by the gigantic combination. President Hadley,
of Yale, declared that unless trusts were regulated the country might expect 'an
emperor in Washington within the next twenty-five years. ' But that able stock
manipulator, Keene, went at his work of shoving the new stock at the public so
vigorously that all the excess water— estimated by some at nearly $600,000,000—
was absorbed in a twinkling. So Carnegie had his millions, and the Morgan
syndicate had $62,000,000 for all its 'trouble, ' and all the 'boys, ' from Gates to
Gary, had their millions.

"The thirty-eight-year-old Schwab had his reward. He was made president
of the new corporation and remained in control until 1930."
The dramatic story of "Big Business" which you have just finished, was
included in this book, because it is a perfect illustration of the method by which
DESIRE CAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO ITS PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT!
I imagine some readers will question the statement that a mere, intangible
DESIRE can be converted into its physical equivalent. Doubtless some will say,
"You cannot convert NOTHING into SOMETHING!" The answer is in the story
of United States Steel.
That giant organization was created in the mind of one man. The plan by
which the organization was provided with the steel mills that gave it financial
stability was created in the mind of the same man. His FAITH, his DESIRE, his
IMAGINATION, his PERSISTENCE were the real ingredients that went into
United States Steel. The steel mills and mechanical equipment acquired by the
corporation, AFTER IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO LEGAL EXISTENCE, were
incidental, but careful analysis will disclose the fact that the appraised value of
the properties acquired by the corporation increased in value by an estimated
SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS, by the mere transaction which
consolidated them under one management.
In other words, Charles M. Schwab's IDEA, plus the FAITH with which he
conveyed it to the minds of J. P. Morgan and the others, was marketed for a
profit of approximately $600,000,000. Not an insignificant sum for a single IDEA!
What happened to some of the men who took their share of the millions of
dollars of profit made by this transaction, is a matter with which we are not now
concerned. The important feature of the astounding achievement is that it serves
as unquestionable evidence of the soundness of the philosophy described in this
book, because this philosophy was the warp and the woof of the entire
transaction. Moreover, the practicability of the philosophy has been established
by the fact that the United States Steel Corporation prospered, and became one of
the richest and most powerful corporations in America, employing thousands of
people, developing new uses for steel, and opening new markets; thus proving
that the $600,000,000 in profit which the Schwab IDEA produced was earned.
RICHES begin in the form of THOUGHT!


The amount is limited only by the person in whose mind the THOUGHT
is put into motion. FAITH removes limitations! Remember this when you are
ready to bargain with Life for whatever it is that you ask as your price for having
passed this way.
Remember, also, that the man who created the United States Steel
Corporation was practically unknown at the time. He was merely Andrew
Carnegie's "Man Friday" until he gave birth to his famous IDEA. After that he
quickly rose to a position of power, fame, and riches.


THERE ARE NO LIMITATIONS
TO THE MIND EXCEPT THOSE
WE ACKNOWLEDGE

BOTH POVERTY AND RICHES ARE THE
OFFSPRING OF THOUGHT


CHAPTER 4
AUTO-SUGGESTION
THE MEDIUM FOR INFLUENCING THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
The Third Step toward Riches
AUTO-SUGGESTION is a term which applies to all suggestions and all
self-administered stimuli which reach one's mind through the five senses. Stated
in another way, auto-suggestion is self-suggestion. It is the agency of
communication between that part of the mind where conscious thought takes
place, and that which serves as the seat of action for the subconscious mind.
Through the dominating thoughts which one permits to remain in the
conscious mind, (whether these thoughts be negative or positive, is immaterial),
the principle of auto-suggestion voluntarily reaches the subconscious mind and
influences it with these thoughts.
NO THOUGHT, whether it be negative or positive, CAN ENTER THE
SUBCONSCIOUS MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTOSUGGESTION, with the exception of thoughts picked up from the ether. Stated
differently, all sense impressions which are perceived through the five senses, are
stopped by the CONSCIOUS thinking mind, and may be either passed on to the
subconscious mind, or rejected, at will. The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as
an outer-guard to the approach of the subconscious.
Nature has so built man that he has ABSOLUTE CONTROL over the
material which reaches his subconscious mind, through his five senses, although
this is not meant to be construed as a statement that man always EXERCISES this
control. In the great majority of instances, he does NOT exercise it, which
explains why so many people go through life in poverty.
Recall what has been said about the subconscious mind resembling a
fertile garden spot, in which weeds will grow in abundance, if the seeds of more
desirable crops are not sown therein. AUTO-SUGGESTION is the agency of
control through which an individual may voluntarily feed his subconscious mind
on thoughts of a creative nature, or, by neglect, permit thoughts of a destructive
nature to find their way into this rich garden of the mind.

You were instructed, in the last of the six steps described in the chapter on
Desire, to read ALOUD twice daily the WRITTEN statement of your DESIRE
FOR MONEY, and to SEE AND FEEL yourself ALREADY in possession of the
money! By following these instructions, you communicate the object of your
DESIRE directly to your SUBCONSCIOUS mind in a spirit of absolute FAITH.
Through repetition of this procedure, you voluntarily create thought habits
which are favorable to your efforts to transmute desire into its monetary
equivalent.
Go back to these six steps described in chapter two, and read them again,
very carefully, before you proceed further. Then (when you come to it), read very
carefully the four instructions for the organization of your "Master Mind" group,
described in the chapter on Organized Planning. By comparing these two sets of
instructions with that which has been stated on auto-suggestion, you, of course,
will see that the instructions involve the application of the principle of autosuggestion.
Remember, therefore, when reading aloud the statement of your desire
(through which you are endeavoring to develop a "money consciousness"), that
the mere reading of the words is of NO CONSEQUENCE— UNLESS you mix
emotion, or feeling with your words. If you repeat a million times the famous
Emil Coué formula, "Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better,"
without mixing emotion and FAITH with your words, you will experience no
desirable results. Your subconscious mind recognizes and acts upon ONLY
thoughts which have been well-mixed with emotion or feeling.
This is a fact of such importance as to warrant repetition in practically
every chapter, because the lack of understanding of this is the main reason the
majority of people who try to apply the principle of auto-suggestion get no
desirable results.
Plain, unemotional words do not influence the subconscious mind. You
will get no appreciable results until you learn to reach your subconscious mind
with thoughts, or spoken words which have been well emotionalized with
BELIEF.
Do not become discouraged, if you cannot control and direct your
emotions the first time you try to do so. Remember, there is no such possibility as
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. Ability to reach, and influence your
subconscious mind has its price, and you MUST PAY THAT PRICE. You cannot
cheat, even if you desire to do so. The price of ability to influence your
subconscious mind is everlasting PERSISTENCE in applying the principles

described here. You cannot develop the desired ability for a lower price. You,
and YOU ALONE, must decide whether or not the reward for which you are
striving (the "money consciousness"), is worth the price you must pay for it in
effort.
Wisdom and "cleverness" alone, will not attract and retain money except
in a few very rare instances, where the law of averages favors the attraction of
money through these sources. The method of attracting money described here,
does not depend upon the law of averages. Moreover, the method plays no
favorites. It will work for one person as effectively as it will for another. Where
failure is experienced, it is the individual, not the method, which has failed. If you
try and fail, make another effort, and still another, until you succeed.
Your ability to use the principle of auto-suggestion will depend, very
largely, upon your capacity to CONCENTRATE upon a given DESIRE until that
desire becomes a BURNING OBSESSION.
When you begin to carry out the instructions in connection with the six
steps described in the second chapter, it will be necessary for you to make use of
the principle of CONCENTRATION.
Let us here offer suggestions for the effective use of concentration. When
you begin to carry out the first of the six steps, which instructs you to "fix in your
own mind the EXACT amount of money you desire," hold your thoughts on that
amount of money by CONCENTRATION, or fixation of attention, with your
eyes closed, until you can ACTUALLY SEE the physical appearance of the
money. Do this at least once each day. As you go through these exercises, follow
the instructions given in the chapter on FAITH, and see yourself actually IN
POSSESSION OF THE MONEY!
Here is a most significant fact— the subconscious mind takes any orders
given it in a spirit of absolute FAITH, and acts upon those orders, although the
orders often have to be presented over and over again, through repetition, before
they are interpreted by the subconscious mind. Following the preceding
statement, consider the possibility of playing a perfectly legitimate "trick" on
your subconscious mind, by making it believe, because you believe it, that you
must have the amount of money you are visualizing, that this money is already
awaiting your claim, that the subconscious mind MUST hand over to you
practical plans for acquiring the money which is yours.
Hand over the thought suggested in the preceding paragraph to your
IMAGINATION, and see what your imagination can, or will do, to create


practical plans for the accumulation of money through transmutation of your
desire.
DO NOT WAIT for a definite plan, through which you intend to exchange
services or merchandise in return for the money you are visualizing, but begin at
once to see yourself in possession of the money, DEMANDING and EXPECTING
meanwhile, that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan, or plans you
need. Be on the alert for these plans, and when they appear, put them into
ACTION IMMEDIATELY. When the plans appear, they will probably "flash"
into your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of an "inspiration." This
inspiration may be considered a direct "telegram," or message from Infinite
Intelligence. Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as you receive it.
Failure to do this will be FATAL to your success.
In the fourth of the six steps, you were instructed to "Create a definite plan
for carrying out your desire, and begin at once to put this plan into action." You
should follow this instruction in the manner described in the preceding
paragraph. Do not trust to your "reason when creating your plan for
accumulating money through the transmutation of desire. Your reason is faulty.
Moreover, your reasoning faculty may be lazy, and, if you depend entirely upon
it to serve you, it may disappoint you.
When visualizing the money you intend to accumulate, (with closed eyes),
see yourself rendering the service, or delivering the merchandise you intend to give in
return for this money. This is important!
SUMMARY OF INSTRUCTIONS
The fact that you are reading this book is an indication that you earnestly
seek knowledge. It is also an indication that you are a student of this subject. If
you are only a student, there is a chance that you may learn much that you did
not know, but you will learn only by assuming an attitude of humility. If you
choose to follow some of the instructions but neglect, or refuse to follow others—
you will fail! To get satisfactory results, you must follow ALL instructions in a
spirit of FAITH.
The instructions given in connection with the six steps in the second
chapter will now be summarized, and blended with the principles covered by
this chapter, as follows:


First. Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night)
where you will not be disturbed or interrupted, close your eyes,
and repeat aloud, (so you may hear your own words) the written
statement of the amount of money you intend to accumulate, the
time limit for its accumulation, and a description of the service or
merchandise you intend to give in return for the money. As you
carry out these instructions, SEE YOURSELF ALREADY IN
POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.
For example :— Suppose that you intend to accumulate
$50,000 by the first of January, five years hence, that you intend to
give personal services in return for the money, in the Capacity of a
salesman. Your written statement of your purpose should be
similar to the following:
"By the first day of January, 19.., I will have in my possession
$50,000, which will come to me in various amounts from time to
time during the interim.
"In return for this money I will give the most efficient service
of which I am capable, rendering the fullest possible quantity, and
the best possible quality of service in the capacity of salesman of
(describe the service or merchandise you intend to sell).
"I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My
faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I
can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the
time, and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to
render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate
this money, and I will follow that plan, when it is received."
Second. Repeat this program night and morning until you
can see, (in your imagination) the money you intend to accumulate.
Third. Place a written copy of your statement where you can
see it night and morning, and read it just before retiring, and upon
arising until it has been memorized.
Remember, as you carry out these instructions, that you are applying the
principle of auto-suggestion, for the purpose of giving orders to your
subconscious mind. Remember, also, that your subconscious mind will act

ONLY upon instructions which are emotionalized, and handed over to it with
"feeling." FAITH is the strongest, and most productive of the emotions. Follow
the instructions given in the chapter on FAITH.
These instructions may, at first, seem abstract. Do not let this disturb you.
Follow the instructions, no matter how abstract or impractical they may, at first,
appear to be. The time will soon come, if you do as you have been instructed, in
spirit as well as in act, when a whole new universe of power will unfold to you.
Scepticism, in connection with ALL new ideas, is characteristic of all
human beings. But if you follow the instructions outlined, your scepticism will
soon be replaced by belief, and this, in turn, will soon become crystallized into
ABSOLUTE FAITH. Then you will have arrived at the point where you may
truly say, "I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul!"
Many philosophers have made the statement, that man is the master of his
own earthly destiny, but most of them have failed to say why he is the master. The
reason that man may be the master of his own earthly status, and especially his
financial status, is thoroughly explained in this chapter. Man may become the
master of himself, and of his environment, because he has the POWER TO
INFLUENCE HIS OWN SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, and through it, gain the
cooperation of Infinite Intelligence.
You are now reading the chapter which represents the keystone to the
arch of this philosophy. The instructions contained in this chapter must be
understood and APPLIED WITH PERSISTENCE, if you succeed in transmuting
desire into money.
The actual performance of transmuting DESIRE into money, involves the
use of auto-suggestion as an agency by which one may reach, and influence, the
subconscious mind. The other principles are simply tools with which to apply
auto-suggestion. Keep this thought in mind, and you will, at all times, be
conscious of the important part the principle of auto-suggestion is to play in your
efforts to accumulate money through the methods described in this book.
Carry out these instructions as though you were a small child. Inject into
your efforts something of the FAITH of a child. The author has been most
careful, to see that no impractical instructions were included, because of his
sincere desire to be helpful.
After you have read the entire book, come back to this chapter, and follow
in spirit, and in action, this instruction:
READ THE ENTIRE CHAPTER ALOUD ONCE EVERY NIGHT, UNTIL
YOU BECOME THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF

AUTO-SUGGESTION IS SOUND, THAT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH FOR YOU
ALL THAT HAS BEEN CLAIMED FOR IT. AS YOU READ, UNDERSCORE
WITH A PENCIL EVERY SENTENCE WHICH IMPRESSES YOU FAVORABLY.
Follow the foregoing instruction to the letter, and it will open the way for
a complete understanding, and mastery of the principles of success.


CHAPTER 5
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OR
OBSERVATIONS
The Fourth Step toward Riches
THERE are two kinds of knowledge. One is general, the other is
specialized. General knowledge, no matter how great in quantity or variety it
may be, is of but little use in the accumulation of money. The faculties of the
great universities possess, in the aggregate, practically every form of general
knowledge known to civilization. Most of the professors have but little or no money.
They specialize on teaching knowledge, but they do not specialize on the
organization, or the use of knowledge.
KNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and
intelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE
END of accumulation of money. Lack of understanding of this fact has been the
source of confusion to millions of people who falsely believe that "knowledge is
power." It is nothing of the sort! Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes
power only when, and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and
directed to a definite end.
This "missing link" in all systems of education known to civilization today,
may be found in the failure of educational institutions to teach their students
HOW TO ORGANIZE AND USE KNOWLEDGE AFTER THEY ACQUIRE IT.
Many people make the mistake of assuming that, because Henry Ford had
but little "schooling," he is not a man of "education." Those who make this
mistake do not know Henry Ford, nor do they understand the real meaning of
the word "educate." That word is derived from the Latin word "educo," meaning
to educe, to draw out, to DEVELOP FROM WITHIN.
An educated man is not, necessarily, one who has an abundance of
general or specialized knowledge. An educated man is one who has so
developed the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its


equivalent, without violating the rights of others. Henry Ford comes well within
the meaning of this definition.
During the world war, a Chicago newspaper published certain editorials
in which, among other statements, Henry Ford was called "an ignorant pacifist."
Mr. Ford objected to the statements, and brought suit against the paper for
libeling him. When the suit was tried in the Courts, the attorneys for the paper
pleaded justification, and placed Mr. Ford, himself, on the witness stand, for the
purpose of proving to the jury that he was ignorant. The attorneys asked Mr.
Ford a great variety of questions, all of them intended to prove, by his own
evidence, that, while he might possess considerable specialized knowledge
pertaining to the manufacture of automobiles, he was, in the main, ignorant.
Mr. Ford was plied with such questions as the following: "Who was
Benedict Arnold?" and "How many soldiers did the British send over to America
to put down the Rebellion of 1776?" In answer to the last question, Mr. Ford
replied, "I do not know the exact number of soldiers the British sent over, but I
have heard that it was a considerably larger number than ever went back."
Finally, Mr. Ford became tired of this line of questioning, and in reply to a
particularly offensive question, he leaned over, pointed his finger at the lawyer
who had asked the question, and said, "If I should really WANT to answer the
foolish question you have just asked, or any of the other questions you have been
asking me, let me remind you that I have a row of electric push-buttons on my
desk, and by pushing the right button, I can summon to my aid men who can
answer ANY question I desire to ask concerning the business to which I am
devoting most of my efforts. Now, will you kindly tell me, WHY I should clutter
up my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able to answer
questions, when I have men around me who can supply any knowledge I
require?"
There certainly was good logic to that reply.
That answer floored the lawyer. Every person in the courtroom realized it
was the answer, not of an ignorant man, but of a man of EDUCATION. Any man
is educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs it, and how to
organize that knowledge into definite plans of action. Through the assistance of
his "Master Mind" group, Henry Ford had at his command all the specialized
knowledge he needed to enable him to become one of the wealthiest men in
America. It was not essential that he have this knowledge in his own mind. Surely no
person who has sufficient inclination and intelligence to read a book of this
nature can possibly miss the significance of this illustration.

Before you can be sure of your ability to transmute DESIRE into its
monetary equivalent, you will require SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE of the
service, merchandise, or profession which you intend to offer in return for
fortune. Perhaps you may need much more specialized knowledge than you
have the ability or the inclination to acquire, and if this should be true, you may
bridge your weakness through the aid of your "Master Mind" group.
Andrew Carnegie stated that he, personally, knew nothing about the
technical end of the steel business; moreover, he did not particularly care to
know anything about it. The specialized knowledge which he required for the
manufacture and marketing of steel, he found available through the individual
units of his MASTER MIND GROUP.
The accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is
acquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized
knowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the
possession of the man who accumulates the fortune.
The preceding paragraph should give hope and encouragement to the
man with ambition to accumulate a fortune, who has not possessed himself of
the necessary "education" to supply such specialized knowledge as he may
require. Men sometimes go through life suffering from "inferiority complexes,"
because they are not men of "education." The man who can organize and direct a
"Master Mind" group of men who possess knowledge useful in the accumulation
of money, is just as much a man of education as any man in the group.
REMEMBER THIS, if you suffer from a feeling of inferiority, because your
schooling has been limited.
Thomas A. Edison had only three months of "schooling" during his entire
life. He did not lack education, neither did he die poor.
Henry Ford had less than a sixth grade "schooling" but he has managed to
do pretty well by himself, financially.
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE is among the most plentiful, and the
cheapest forms of service which may be had! If you doubt this, consult the
payroll of any university.
IT PAYS TO KNOW HOW TO PURCHASE KNOWLEDGE
First of all, decide the sort of specialized knowledge you require, and the
purpose for which it is needed. To a large extent your major purpose in life, the
goal toward which you are working, will help determine what knowledge you

need. With this question settled, your next move requires that you have accurate
information concerning dependable sources of knowledge. The more important
of these are:
(a) One's own experience and education
(b) Experience and education available through cooperation of others
(Master Mind Alliance)
(c) Colleges and Universities
(d) Public Libraries (Through books and periodicals in which may be
found all the knowledge organized by civilization)
(e) Special Training Courses (Through night schools and home study
schools in particular.)
As knowledge is acquired it must be organized and put into use, for a
definite purpose, through practical plans. Knowledge has no value except that
which can be gained from its application toward some worthy end. This is one
reason why college degrees are not valued more highly. They represent nothing
but miscellaneous knowledge.
If you contemplate taking additional schooling, first determine the
purpose for which you want the knowledge you are seeking, then learn where
this particular sort of knowledge can be obtained, from reliable sources.
Successful men, in all callings, never stop acquiring specialized
knowledge related to their major purpose, business, or profession. Those who are
not successful usually make the mistake of believing that the knowledge
acquiring period ends when one finishes school. The truth is that schooling does
but little more than to put one in the way of learning how to acquire practical
knowledge.
With this Changed World which began at the end of the economic
collapse, came also astounding changes in educational requirements. The order
of the day is SPECIALIZATION! This truth was emphasized by Robert P. Moore,
secretary of appointments of Columbia University.
"SPECIALISTS MOST SOUGHT
"Particularly sought after by employing companies are candidates who
have specialized in some field— business-school graduates with training in


accounting and statistics, engineers of all varieties, journalists, architects,
chemists, and also outstanding leaders and activity men of the senior class.
"The man who has been active on the campus, whose personality is such
that he gets along with all kinds of people and who has done an adequate job
with his studies has a most decided edge over the strictly academic student.
Some of these, because of their all-around qualifications, have received several
offers of positions, a few of them as many as six.
"In departing from the conception that the 'straight A' student was
invariably the one to get the choice of the better jobs, Mr. Moore said that most
companies look not only to academic records but to activity records and
personalities of the students.
"One of the largest industrial companies, the leader in its field, in writing
to Mr. Moore concerning prospective seniors at the college, said:
"' We are interested primarily in finding men who can make exceptional
progress in management work. For this reason we emphasize qualities of
character, intelligence and personality far more than specific educational
background.'
"APPRENTICESHIP' PROPOSED
"Proposing a system of 'apprenticing' students in offices, stores and
industrial occupations during the summer vacation, Mr. Moore asserts that after
the first two or three years of college, every student should be asked 'to choose a
definite future course and to call a halt if he has been merely pleasantly drifting
without purpose through an unspecialized academic curriculum.'
"Colleges and universities must face the practical consideration that all
professions and occupations now demand specialists," he said, urging that
educational institutions accept more direct responsibility for vocational
guidance. One of the most reliable and practical sources of knowledge available
to those who need specialized schooling, is the night schools operated in most
large cities. The correspondence schools give specialized training anywhere the
U. S. mails go, on all subjects that can be taught by the extension method. One
advantage of home study training is the flexibility of the study programme
which permits one to study during spare time. Another stupendous advantage of
home study training (if the school is carefully chosen), is the fact that most
courses offered by home study schools carry with them generous privileges of


consultation which can be of priceless value to those needing specialized
knowledge. No matter where you live, you can share the benefits.
Anything acquired without effort, and without cost is generally
unappreciated, often discredited; perhaps this is why we get so little from our
marvelous opportunity in public schools. The SELF-DISCIPLINE one receives
from a definite programme of specialized study makes up to some extent, for the
wasted opportunity when knowledge was available without cost.
Correspondence schools are highly organized business institutions. Their tuition
fees are so low that they are forced to insist upon prompt payments. Being asked
to pay, whether the student makes good grades or poor, has the effect of causing
one to follow through with the course when he would otherwise drop it. The
correspondence schools have not stressed this point sufficiently, for the truth is
that their collection departments constitute the very finest sort of training on
DECISION, PROMPTNESS, ACTION and THE HABIT OF FINISHING THAT
WHICH ONE BEGINS.
I learned this from experience, more than twenty-five years ago. I enrolled
for a home study course in Advertising. After completing eight or ten lessons I
stopped studying, but the school did not stop sending me bills. Moreover, it
insisted upon payment, whether I kept up my studies or not. I decided that if I
had to pay for the course (which I had legally obligated myself to do), I should
complete the lessons and get my money's worth. I felt, at the time, that the
collection system of the school was somewhat too well organized, but I learned
later in life that it was a valuable part of my training for which no charge had
been made. Being forced to pay, I went ahead and completed the course. Later in
life I discovered that the efficient collection system of that school had been worth
much in the form of money earned, because of the training in advertising I had
so reluctantly taken.
We have in this country what is said to be the greatest public school
system in the world. We have invested fabulous sums for fine buildings, we have
provided convenient transportation for children living in the rural districts, so
they may attend the best schools, but there is one astounding weakness to this
marvelous system— IT IS FREE! One of the strange things about human beings is
that they value only that which has a price. The free schools of America, and the
free public libraries, do not impress people because they are free. This is the
major reason why so many people find it necessary to acquire additional training
after they quit school and go lo work. It is also one of the major reasons why
EMPLOYERS GIVE GREATER CONSIDERATION TO EMPLOYEES WHO

TAKE HOME STUDY COURSES. They have learned, from experience, that any
person who has the ambition to give up a part of his spare time to studying at
home has in him those qualities which make for leadership. This recognition is
not a charitable gesture, it is sound business judgment upon the part of the
employers.
There is one weakness in people for which there is no remedy. It is the
universal weakness of LACK OF AMBITION! Persons, especially salaried people,
who schedule their spare time, to provide for home study, seldom remain at the
bottom very long. Their action opens the way for the upward climb, removes
many obstacles from their path, and gains the friendly interest of those who have
the power to put them in the way of OPPORTUNITY.
The home study method of training is especially suited to the needs of
employed people who find, after leaving school, that they must acquire
additional specialized knowledge, but cannot spare the time to go back to school.
The changed economic conditions prevailing since the depression have
made it necessary for thousands of people to find additional, or new sources of
income. For the majority of these, the solution to their problem may be found
only by acquiring specialized knowledge. Many will be forced to change their
occupations entirely. When a merchant finds that a certain line of merchandise is
not selling, he usually supplants it with another that is in demand. The person
whose business is that of marketing personal services must also be an efficient
merchant. If his services do not bring adequate returns in one occupation, he
must change to another, where broader opportunities are available.
Stuart Austin Wier prepared himself as a Construction Engineer and
followed this line of work until the depression limited his market to where it did
not give him the income he required. He took inventory of himself, decided to
change his profession to law, went back to school and took special courses by
which he prepared himself as a corporation lawyer. Despite the fact the
depression had not ended, he completed his training, passed the Bar
Examination, and quickly built a lucrative law practice, in Dallas, Texas; in fact
he is turning away clients.
Just to keep the record straight, and to anticipate the alibis of those who
will say, "I couldn't go to school because I have a family to support," or "I'm too
old," I will add the information that Mr. Wier was past forty, and married when
he went back to school. Moreover, by carefully selecting highly specialized
courses, in colleges best prepared to teach the subjects chosen, Mr. Wier


completed in two years the work for which the majority of law students require
four years. IT PAYS TO KNOW HOW TO PURCHASE KNOWLEDGE!
The person who stops studying merely because he has finished school is
forever hopelessly doomed to mediocrity, no matter what may be his calling. The
way of success is the way of continuous pursuit of knowledge.
Let us consider a specific instance.
During the depression a salesman in a grocery store found himself
without a position. Having had some bookkeeping experience, he took a special
course in accounting, familiarized himself with all the latest bookkeeping and
office equipment, and went into business for himself. Starting with the grocer for
whom he had formerly worked, he made contracts with more than 100 small
merchants to keep their books, at a very nominal monthly fee. His idea was so
practical that he soon found it necessary to set up a portable office in a light
delivery truck, which he equipped with modern bookkeeping machinery. He
now has a fleet of these bookkeeping offices "on wheels" and employs a large
staff of assistants, thus providing small merchants with accounting service equal
to the best that money can buy, at very nominal cost.
Specialized knowledge, plus imagination, were the ingredients that went
into this unique and successful business. Last year the owner of that business
paid an income tax of almost ten times as much as was paid by the merchant for
whom he worked when the depression forced upon him a temporary adversity
which proved to be a blessing in disguise.
The beginning of this successful business was an IDEA!
Inasmuch as I had the privilege of supplying the unemployed salesman
with that idea, I now assume the further privilege of suggesting another idea
which has within it the possibility of even greater income. Also the possibility of
rendering useful service to thousands of people who badly need that service.
The idea was suggested by the salesman who gave up selling and went
into the business of keeping books on a wholesale basis. When the plan was
suggested as a solution of his unemployment problem, he quickly exclaimed, "I
like the idea, but I would not know how to turn it into cash." In other words, he
complained he would not know how to market his bookkeeping knowledge after
he acquired it.
So, that brought up another problem which had to be solved. With the aid
of a young woman typist, clever at hand lettering, and who could put the story
together, a very attractive book was prepared, describing the advantages of the
new system of book-keeping. The pages were neatly typed and pasted in an

ordinary scrapbook, which was used as a silent salesman with which the story of
this new business was so effectively told that its owner soon had more accounts
than he could handle.
There are thousands of people, all over the country, who need the services
of a merchandising specialist capable of preparing an attractive brief for use in
marketing personal services. The aggregate annual income from such a service
might easily exceed that received by the largest employment agency, and the
benefits of the service might be made far greater to the purchaser than any to be
obtained from an employment agency.
The IDEA here described was born of necessity, to bridge an emergency
which had to be covered, but it did not stop by merely serving one person. The
woman who created the idea has a keen IMAGINATION. She saw in her newly
born brain-child the making of a new profession, one that is destined to render
valuable service to thousands of people who need practical guidance in
marketing personal services.
Spurred to action by the instantaneous success of her first "PREPARED
PLAN TO MARKET PERSONAL SERVICES," this energetic woman turned next
to the solution of a similar problem for her son who had just finished college, but
had been totally unable to find a market for his services. The plan she originated
for his use was the finest specimen of merchandising of personal services I have
ever seen.
When the plan book had been completed, it contained nearly fifty pages of
beautifully typed, properly organized information, telling the story of her son's
native ability, schooling, personal experiences, and a great variety of other
information too extensive for description. The plan book also contained a
complete description of the position her son desired, together with a marvelous
word picture of the exact plan he would use in filling the position.
The preparation of the plan book required several week's labor, during
which time its creator sent her son to the public library almost daily, to procure
data needed in selling his services to best advantage. She sent him, also to all the
competitors of his prospective employer, and gathered from them vital
information concerning their business methods which was of great value in the
formation of the plan he intended to use in filling the position he sought. When
the plan had been finished, it contained more than half a dozen very fine
suggestions for the use and benefit of the prospective employer. (The suggestions
were put into use by the company).


One may be inclined to ask, "Why go to all this trouble to secure a job?"
The answer is straight to the point, also it is dramatic, because it deals with a
subject which assumes the proportion of a tragedy with millions of men and
women whose sole source of income is personal services.
The answer is, "DOING A THING WELL NEVER IS TROUBLE! THE
PLAN PREPARED BY THIS WOMAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER SON,
HELPED HIM GET THE JOB FOR WHICH HE APPLIED, AT THE FIRST
INTERVIEW, AT A SALARY FIXED BY HIMSELF."
Moreover— and this, too, is important— THE POSITION DID NOT
REQUIRE THE YOUNG MAN TO START AT THE BOTTOM. HE BEGAN AS A
JUNIOR EXECUTIVE, AT AN EXECUTIVE'S SALARY.
"Why go to all this trouble?" do you ask?
Well, for one thing, the PLANNED PRESENTATION of this young man's
application for a position clipped off no less than ten years of time he would
have required to get to where he began, had he "started at the bottom and
worked his way up."
This idea of starting at the bottom and working one's way up may appear
to be sound, but the major objection to it is this— too many of those who begin at
the bottom never manage to lift their heads high enough to be seen by
OPPORTUNITY, so they remain at the bottom. It should be remembered, also,
that the outlook from the bottom is not so very bright or encouraging. It has a
tendency to kill off ambition. We call it "getting into a rut," which means that we
accept our fate because we form the HABIT of daily routine, a habit that finally
becomes so strong we cease to try to throw it off. And that is another reason why
it pays to start one or two steps above the bottom. By so doing one forms the
HABIT of looking around, of observing how others get ahead, of seeing
OPPORTUNITY, and of embracing it without hesitation.
Dan Halpin is a splendid example of what I mean. During his college
days, he was manager of the famous 1930 National Championship Notre Dame
football team, when it was under the direction of the late Knute Rockne.
Perhaps he was inspired by the great football coach to aim high, and NOT
MISTAKE TEMPORARY DEFEAT FOR FAILURE, just as Andrew Carnegie, the
great industrial leader, inspired his young business lieutenants to set high goals
for themselves. At any rate, young Halpin finished college at a mighty
unfavorable time, when the depression had made jobs scarce, so, after a fling at
investment banking and motion pictures, he took the first opening with a
potential future he could find— selling electrical hearing aids on a commission

basis. ANYONE COULD START IN THAT SORT OF JOB, AND HALPIN KNEW
IT, but it was enough to open the door of opportunity to him.
For almost two years, he continued in a job not to his liking, and he would
never have risen above that job if he had not done something about his
dissatisfaction. He aimed, first, at the job of Assistant Sales Manager of his
company, and got the job. That one step upward placed him high enough above
the crowd to enable him to see still greater opportunity, also, it placed him where
OPPORTUNITY COULD SEE HIM.
He made such a fine record selling hearing aids, that A. M. Andrews,
Chairman of the Board of the Dictograph Products Company, a business
competitor of the company for which Halpin worked, wanted to know
something about that man Dan Halpin who was taking big sales away from the
long established Dictograph Company. He sent for Halpin. When the interview
was over, Halpin was the new Sales Manager, in charge of the Acousticon
Division. Then, to test young Halpin's metal, Mr. Andrews went away to Florida
for three months, leaving him to sink or swim in his new job. He did not sink!
Knute Rockne's spirit of "All the world loves a winner, and has no time for a
loser inspired him to put so much into his job that he was recently elected VicePresident of the company, and General Manager of the Acousticon and Silent
Radio Division, a job which most men would be proud to earn through ten years
of loyal effort. Halpin turned the trick in little more than six months.
It is difficult to say whether Mr. Andrews or Mr. Halpin is more deserving
of eulogy, for the reason that both showed evidence of having an abundance of
that very rare quality known as IMAGINATION. Mr. Andrews deserves credit
for seeing, in young Halpin, a "go-getter" of the highest order. Halpin deserves
credit for REFUSING TO COMPROMISE WITH LIFE BY ACCEPTING AND
KEEPING A JOB HE DID NOT WANT, and that is one of the major points I am
trying to emphasize through this entire philosophy— that we rise to high
positions or remain at the bottom BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS WE CAN
CONTROL IF WE DESIRE TO CONTROL THEM.
I am also trying to emphasize another point, namely, that both success and
failure are largely the results of HABIT! I have not the slightest doubt that Dan
Halpin's close association with the greatest football coach America ever knew,
planted in his mind the same brand of DESIRE to excel which made the Notre
Dame football team world famous. Truly, there is something to the idea that
hero-worship is helpful, provided one worships a WINNER. Halpin tells me that
Rockne was one of the world's greatest leaders of men in all history.

My belief in the theory that business associations are vital factors, both in
failure and in success, was recently demonstrated, when my son Blair was
negotiating with Dan Halpin for a position. Mr. Halpin offered him a beginning
salary of about one half what he could have gotten from a rival company. I
brought parental pressure to bear, and induced him to accept the place with Mr.
Halpin, because I BELIEVE THAT CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH ONE WHO
REFUSES TO COMPROMISE WITH CIRCUMSTANCES HE DOES NOT LIKE,
IS AN ASSET THAT CAN NEVER BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF MONEY.
The bottom is a monotonous, dreary, unprofitable place for any person.
That is why I have taken the time to describe how lowly beginnings may be
circumvented by proper planning. Also, that is why so much space has been
devoted to a description of this new profession, created by a woman who was
inspired to do a fine job of PLANNING because she wanted her son to have a
favorable "break."
With the changed conditions ushered in by the world economic collapse,
came also the need for newer and better ways of marketing PERSONAL
SERVICES. It is hard to determine why someone had not previously discovered
this stupendous need, in view of the fact that more money changes hands in
return for personal services than for any other purpose. The sum paid out
monthly, to people who work for wages and salaries, is so huge that it runs into
hundreds of millions, and the annual distribution amounts to billions.
Perhaps some will find, in the IDEA here briefly described, the nucleus of
the riches they DESIRE! Ideas with much less merit have been the seedlings from
which great fortunes have grown. Woolworth's Five and Ten Cent Store idea, for
example, had far less merit, but it piled up a fortune for its creator.
Those seeing OPPORTUNITY lurking in this suggestion will find valuable
aid in the chapter on Organized Planning. Incidentally, an efficient merchandiser
of personal services would find a growing demand for his services wherever
there are men and women who seek better markets for their services. By
applying the Master Mind principle, a few people with suitable talent, could
form an alliance, and have a paying business very quickly. One would need to be
a fair writer, with a flair for advertising and selling, one handy at typing and
hand lettering, and one should be a first class business getter who would let the
world know about the service. If one person possessed all these abilities, he
might carry on the business alone, until it outgrew him.
The woman who prepared the "Personal Service Sales Plan" for her son
now receives requests from all parts of the country for her cooperation in

preparing similar plans for others who desire to market their personal services
for more money. She has a staff of expert typists, artists, and writers who have
the ability to dramatize the case history so effectively that one's personal services
can be marketed for much more money than the prevailing wages for similar
services. She is so confident of her ability that she accepts, as the major portion of
her fee, a percentage of the increased pay she helps her clients to earn.
It must not be supposed that her plan merely consists of clever
salesmanship by which she helps men and women to demand and receive more
money for he same services they formerly sold for less pay. She looks after the
interests of the purchaser as well as the seller of personal services, and so
prepares her plans that the employer receives full value for the additional money
he pays. The method by which she accomplishes this astonishing result is a
professional secret which she discloses to no one excepting her own clients.
If you have the IMAGINATION, and seek a more profitable outlet for
your personal services, this suggestion may be the stimulus for which you have
been searching. The IDEA is capable of yielding an income far greater than that
of the "average" doctor, lawyer, or engineer whose education required several
years in college. The idea is saleable to those seeking new positions, in practically
all positions calling for managerial or executive ability, and those desiring rearrangement of incomes in their present positions.
There is no fixed price for sound IDEAS!
Back of all IDEAS is specialized knowledge. Unfortunately, for those who
do not find riches in abundance, specialized knowledge is more abundant and
more easily acquired than IDEAS. Because of this very truth, there is a universal
demand and an ever-increasing opportunity for the person capable of helping
men and women to sell their personal services advantageously. Capability means
IMAGINATION, the one quality needed to combine specialized knowledge with
IDEAS, in the form of ORGANIZED PLANS designed to yield riches.
If you have IMAGINATION this chapter may present you with an idea
sufficient to serve as the beginning of the riches you desire. Remember, the IDEA
is the main thing. Specialized knowledge may be found just around the corner—
any corner!


CHAPTER 6
IMAGINATION
THE WORKSHOP OF THE MIND
The Fifth Step toward Riches
The imagination is literally the workshop wherein are fashioned all plans
created by man. The impulse, the DESIRE, is given shape, form, and ACTION
through the aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind.
It has been said that man can create anything which he can imagine.
Of all the ages of civilization, this is the most favorable for the
development of the imagination, because it is an age of rapid change. On every
hand one may contact stimuli which develop the imagination.
Through the aid of his imaginative faculty, man has discovered, and
harnessed, more of Nature's forces during the past fifty years than during the
entire history of the human race, previous to that time. He has conquered the air
so completely, that the birds are a poor match for him in flying. He has harnessed
the ether, and made it serve as a means of instantaneous communication with
any part of the world. He has analyzed, and weighed the sun at a distance of
millions of miles, and has determined, through the aid of IMAGINATION, the
elements of which it consists. He has discovered that his own brain is both a
broadcasting, and a receiving station for the vibration of thought, and he is
beginning now to learn how to make practical use of this discovery. He has
increased the speed of locomotion, until he may now travel at a speed of more
than three hundred miles an hour. The time will soon come when a man may
breakfast in New York, and lunch in San Francisco.
MAN'S ONLY LIMITATION, within reason, LIES IN HIS
DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF HIS IMAGINATION. He has not yet reached the
apex of development in the use of his imaginative faculty. He has merely
discovered that he has an imagination, and has commenced to use it in a very
elementary way.
TWO FORMS OF IMAGINATION

The imaginative faculty functions in two forms. One is known as
"synthetic imagination," and the other as "creative imagination."
SYNTHETIC IMAGINATION:— Through this faculty, one may arrange
old concepts, ideas, or plans into new combinations. This faculty creates nothing.
It merely works with the material of experience, education, and observation with
which it is fed. It is the faculty used most by the inventor, with the exception of
the who draws upon the creative imagination, when he cannot solve his problem
through synthetic imagination.
CREATIVE IMAGINATION:— Through the faculty of creative imagination,
the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. It is
the faculty through which "hunches" and "inspirations" are received. It is by this
faculty that all basic, or new ideas are handed over to man.
It is through this faculty that thought vibrations from the minds of others
are received. It is through this faculty that one individual may "tune in," or
communicate with the subconscious minds of other men.
The creative imagination works automatically, in the manner described in
subsequent pages. This faculty functions ONLY when the conscious mind is
vibrating at an exceedingly rapid rate, as for example, when the conscious mind
is stimulated through the emotion of a strong desire.
The creative faculty becomes more alert, more receptive to vibrations from
the sources mentioned, in proportion to its development through USE. This
statement is significant! Ponder over it before passing on.
Keep in mind as you follow these principles, that the entire story of how
one may convert DESIRE into money cannot be told in one statement. The story
will be complete, only when one has MASTERED, ASSIMILATED, and BEGUN
TO MAKE USE of all the principles.
The great leaders of business, industry, finance, and the great artists,
musicians, poets, and writers became great, because they developed the faculty
of creative imagination.
Both the synthetic and creative faculties of imagination become more alert
with use, just as any muscle or organ of the body develops through use.
Desire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is
abstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical
counterpart. While the synthetic imagination is the one which will be used most
frequently, in the process of transforming the impulse of DESIRE into money,


you must keep in mind the fact, that you may face circumstances and situations
which demand use of the creative imagination as well.
Your imaginative faculty may have become weak through inaction. It can
be revived and made alert through USE. This faculty does not die, though it may
become quiescent through lack of use.
Center your attention, for the time being, on the development of the
synthetic imagination, because this is the faculty which you will use more often
in the process of converting desire into money.
Transformation of the intangible impulse, of DESIRE, into the tangible
reality, of MONEY, calls for the use of a plan, or plans. These plans must be
formed with the aid of the imagination, and mainly, with the synthetic faculty.
Read the entire book through, then come back to this chapter, and begin at
once to put your imagination to work on the building of a plan, or plans, for the
transformation of your DESIRE into money. Detailed instructions for the
building of plans have been given in almost every chapter. Carry out the
instructions best suited to your needs, reduce your plan to writing, if you have
not already done so. The moment you complete this, you will have DEFINITELY
given concrete form to the intangible DESIRE. Read the preceding sentence once
more. Read it aloud, very slowly, and as you do so, remember that the moment
you reduce the statement of your desire, and a plan for its realization, to writing,
you have actually TAKEN THE FIRST of a series of steps, which will enable you
to convert the thought into its physical counterpart.
The earth on which you live, you, yourself, and every other material thing
are the result of evolutionary change, through which microscopic bits of matter
have been organized and arranged in an orderly fashion.
Moreover— and this statement is of stupendous importance— this earth,
every one of the billions of individual cells of your body, and every atom of
matter, began as an intangible form of energy.
DESIRE is thought impulse! Thought impulses are forms of energy. When
you begin with the thought impulse, DESIRE, to accumulate money, you are
drafting into your service the same "stuff" that Nature used in creating this earth,
and every material form in the universe, including the body and brain in which
the thought impulses function.
As far as science has been able to determine, the entire universe consists of
but two elements—matter and energy.


Through the combination of energy and matter, has been created
everything perceptible to man, from the largest star which floats in the heavens,
down to, and including man, himself.
You are now engaged in the task of trying to profit by Nature's method.
You are (sincerely and earnestly, we hope), trying to adapt yourself to Nature's
laws, by endeavoring to convert DESIRE into its physical or monetary
equivalent.
YOU CAN DO IT! IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE!
You can build a fortune through the aid of laws which are immutable. But,
first, you must become familiar with these laws, and learn to USE them. Through
repetition, and by approaching the description of these principles from every
conceivable angle, the author hopes to reveal to you the secret through which
every great fortune has been accumulated. Strange and paradoxical as it may
seem, the "secret" is NOT A SECRET. Nature, herself, advertises it in the earth on
which we live, the stars, the planets suspended within our view, in the elements
above and around us, in every blade of grass, and every form of life within our
vision.
Nature advertises this "secret" in the terms of biology, in the conversion of
a tiny cell, so small that it may be lost on the point of a pin, into the HUMAN
BEING now reading this line. The conversion of desire into its physical
equivalent is, certainly, no more miraculous!
Do not become discouraged if you do not fully comprehend all that has
been stated. Unless you have long been a student of the mind, it is not to be
expected that you will assimilate all that is in this chapter upon a first reading.
But you will, in time, make good progress.
The principles which follow will open the way for understanding of
imagination. Assimilate that which you understand, as you read this philosophy
for the first time, then, when you reread and study it, you will discover that
something has happened to clarify it, and give you a broader understanding of
the whole. Above all, DO NOT STOP, nor hesitate in your study of these
principles until you have read the book at least THREE times, for 95 96 then, you
will not want to stop.
HOW TO MAKE PRACTICAL USE OF IMAGINATION
Ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes. Ideas are products of the
imagination. Let us examine a few well known ideas which have yielded huge

fortunes, with the hope that these illustrations will convey definite information
concerning the method by which imagination may be used in accumulating
riches.
THE ENCHANTED KETTLE
Fifty years ago, an old country doctor drove to town, hitched his horse,
quietly slipped into a drug store by the back door, and began "dickering" with
the young drug clerk.
His mission was destined to yield great wealth to many people. It was
destined to bring to the South the most far-flung benefit since the Civil War.
For more than an hour, behind the prescription counter, the old doctor
and the clerk talked in low tones. Then the doctor left. He went out to the buggy
and brought back a large, old fashioned kettle, a big wooden paddle (used for
stirring the contents of the kettle), and deposited them in the back of the store.
The clerk inspected the kettle, reached into his inside pocket, took out a
roll of bills, and handed it over to the doctor. The roll contained exactly $500.00—
the clerk's entire savings! The doctor handed over a small slip of paper on which
was written a secret formula. The words on that small slip of paper were worth a
King's ransom! But not to the doctor! Those magic words were needed to start
the kettle to boiling, but neither the doctor nor the young clerk knew what
fabulous fortunes were destined to flow from that kettle.
The old doctor was glad to sell the outfit for five hundred dollars. The
money would pay off his debts, and give him freedom of mind. The clerk was
taking a big chance by staking his entire life's savings on a mere scrap of paper
and an old kettle! He never dreamed his investment would start a kettle to
overflowing with gold that would surpass the miraculous performance of
Aladdin's lamp.
What the clerk really purchased was an IDEA! The old kettle and the
wooden paddle, and the secret message on a slip of paper were incidental. The
strange performance of that kettle began to take place after the new owner mixed
with the secret instructions an ingredient of which the doctor knew nothing.
Read this story carefully, give your imagination a test! See if you can
discover what it was that the young man added to the secret message, which
caused the kettle to overflow with gold. Remember, as you read, that this is not a
story from Arabian Nights. Here you have a story of facts, stranger than fiction,
facts which began in the form of an IDEA.

Let us take a look at the vast fortunes of gold this idea has produced. It
has paid, and still pays huge fortunes to men and women all over the world, who
distribute the contents of the kettle to millions of people.
The Old Kettle is now one of the world's largest consumers of sugar, thus
providing jobs of a permanent nature to thousands of men and women engaged
in growing sugar cane, and in refining and marketing sugar.
The Old Kettle consumes, annually, millions of glass bottles, providing
jobs to huge numbers of glass workers.
The Old Kettle gives employment to an army of clerks, stenographers,
copy writers, and advertising experts throughout the nation. It has brought fame
and fortune to scores of artists who have created magnificent pictures describing
the product.
The Old Kettle has converted a small Southern city into the business
capital of the South, where it now benefits, directly, or indirectly, every business
and practically every resident of the city. The influence of this idea now benefits
every civilized country in the world, pouring out a continuous stream of gold to
all who touch it.
Gold from the kettle built and maintains one of the most prominent
colleges of the South, where thousands of young people receive the training
essential for success.
The Old Kettle has done other marvelous things. All through the world
depression, when factories, banks and business houses were folding up and
quitting by the thousands, the owner of this Enchanted Kettle went marching on,
giving continuous employment to an army of men and women all over the world,
and paying out extra portions of gold to those who, long ago, had faith in the idea.
If the product of that old brass kettle could talk, it would tell thrilling tales
of romance in every language. Romances of love, romances of business,
romances of professional men and women who are daily being stimulated by it.
The author is sure of at least one such romance, for he was a part of it, and
it all began not far from the very spot on which the drug clerk purchased the old
kettle. It was here that the author met his wife, and it was she who first told him
of the Enchanted Kettle. It was the product of that Kettle they were drinking
when he asked her to accept him "for better or worse."
Now that you know the content of the Enchanted Kettle is a world famous
drink, it is fitting that the author confess that the home city of the drink supplied
him with a wife, also that the drink itself provides him with stimulation of thought


without intoxication, and thereby it serves to give the refreshment of mind which
an author must have to do his best work.
Whoever you are, wherever you may live, whatever occupation you may
be engaged in, just remember in the future, every time you see the words "CocaCola," that its vast empire of wealth and influence grew out of a single IDEA, and
that the mysterious ingredient the drug clerk— Asa Candler— mixed with the
secret formula was. . . IMAGINATION!
Stop and think of that, for a moment.
Remember, also, that the thirteen steps to riches, described in this book,
were the media through which the influence of Coca-Cola has been extended to
every city, town, village, and cross-roads of the world, and that ANY IDEA you
may create, as sound and meritorious as Coca-Cola, has the possibility of
duplicating the stupendous record of this world-wide thirst-killer.
Truly, thoughts are things, and their scope of operation is the world, itself.
WHAT I WOULD DO IF I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
This story proves the truth of that old saying, "where there's a will, there's
a way." It was told to me by that beloved educator and clergyman, the late Frank
W. Gunsaulus, who began his preaching career in the stockyards region of South
Chicago.
While Dr. Gunsaulus was going through college, he observed many
defects in our educational system, defects which he believed he could correct, if
he were the head of a college. His deepest desire was to become the directing head
of an educational institution in which young men and women would be taught
to "learn by doing."
He made up his mind to organize a new college in which he could carry
out his ideas, without being handicapped by orthodox methods of education.
He needed a million dollars to put the project across! Where was he to lay
his hands on so large a sum of money? That was the question that absorbed most
of this ambitious young preacher's thought.
But he couldn't seem to make any progress.
Every night he took that thought to bed with him. He got up with it in the
morning. He took it with him everywhere he went. He turned it over and over in
his mind until it became a consuming obsession with him. A million dollars is a
lot of money. He recognized that fact, but he also recognized the truth that the
only limitation is that which one sets up in one's own mind.

Being a philosopher as well as a preacher, Dr. Gunsaulus recognized, as
do all who succeed in life, that DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE is the starting
point from which one must begin. He recognized, too, that definiteness of
purpose takes on animation, life, and power when backed by a BURNING
DESIRE to translate that purpose into its material equivalent.
He knew all these great truths, yet he did not know where, or how to lay
his hands on a million dollars. The natural procedure would have been to give
up and quit, by saying, "Ah well, my idea is a good one, but I cannot do anything
with it, because I never can procure the necessary million dollars." That is exactly
what the majority of people would have said, but it is not what Dr. Gunsaulus
said. What he said, and what he did are so important that I now introduce him,
and let him speak for himself.
"One Saturday afternoon I sat in my room thinking of ways and means of
raising the money to carry out my plans. For nearly two years, I had been
thinking, but I had done nothing but think!
"The time had come for ACTION!
"I made up my mind, then and there, that I would get the necessary
million dollars within a week. How? I was not concerned about that. The main
thing of importance was the decision to get the money within a specified time,
and I want to tell you that the moment I reached a definite decision to get the
money within a specified time, a strange feeling of assurance came over me, such
as I had never before experienced. Something inside me seemed to say, 'Why
didn't you reach that decision a long time ago? The money was waiting for you
all the time!'
"Things began to happen in a hurry. I called the newspapers and
announced I would preach a sermon the following morning, entitled, 'What I
would do if I had a Million Dollars.'
"I went to work on the sermon immediately, but I must tell you, frankly,
the task was not difficult, because I had been preparing that sermon for almost
two years. The spirit back of it was a part of me!
"Long before midnight I had finished writing the sermon. I went to bed
and slept with a feeling of confidence, for I could see myself already in.
possession of the million dollars.
"Next morning I arose early, went into the bathroom, read the sermon,
then knelt on my knees and asked that my sermon might come to the attention of
someone who would supply the needed money.


"While I was praying I again had that feeling of assurance that the money
would be forthcoming. In my excitement, I walked out without my sermon, and
did not discover the oversight until I was in my pulpit and about ready to begin
delivering it.
"It was too late to go back for my notes, and what a blessing that I couldn't
go back! Instead, my own subconscious mind yielded the material I needed.
When I arose to begin my sermon, I closed my eyes, and spoke with all my heart
and soul of my dreams. I not only talked to my audience, but I fancy I talked also
to God. I told what I would do with a million dollars if that amount were placed
in my hands. I described the plan I had in mind for organizing a great
educational institution, where young people would learn to do practical things,
and at the same time develop their minds.
"When I had finished and sat down, a man slowly arose from his seat,
about three rows from the rear, and made his way toward the pulpit. I wondered
what he was going to do. He came into the pulpit, extended his hand, and said,
'Reverend, I liked your sermon. I believe you can do everything you said you
would, if you had a million dollars. To prove that I believe in you and your
sermon, if you will come to my office tomorrow morning, I will give you the
million dollars. My name is Phillip D. Armour."'
Young Gunsaulus went to Mr. Armour's office and the million dollars was
presented to him. With the money, he founded the Armour Institute of
Technology.
That is more money than the majority of preachers ever see in an entire
lifetime, yet the thought impulse back of the money was created m the young
preacher's mind in a fraction of a minute. The necessary million dollars came as a
result of an idea. Back of the idea was a DESIRE which young Gunsaulus had
been nursing in his mind for almost two years.
Observe this important fact... HE GOT THE MONEY WITHIN THIRTYSIX HOURS AFTER HE REACHED A DEFINITE DECISION IN HIS OWN
MIND TO GET IT, AND DECIDED UPON A DEFINITE PLAN FOR GETTING
IT!
There was nothing new or unique about young Gunsaulus' vague
thinking about a million dollars, and weakly hoping for it. Others before him,
and many since his time, have had similar thoughts. But there was something
very unique and different about the decision he reached on that memorable
Saturday, when he put vagueness into the background, and definitely said, "I
WILL get that money within a week!"

God seems to throw Himself on the side of the man who knows exactly
what he wants, if he is determined to get JUST THAT!
Moreover, the principle through which Dr. Gunsaulus got his million
dollars is still alive! It is available to you! This universal law is as workable today
as it was when the young preacher made use of it so successfully. This book
describes, step by step, the thirteen elements of this great law, and suggests how
they may be put to use.
Observe that Asa Candler and Dr. Frank Gunsaulus had one characteristic
in common. Both knew the astounding truth that IDEAS CAN BE
TRANSMUTED INTO CASH THROUGH THE POWER OF DEFINITE
PURPOSE, PLUS DEFINITE PLANS.
If you are one of those who believe that hard work and honesty, alone,
will bring riches, perish the thought! It is not true! Riches, when they come in
huge quantities, are never the result of HARD work! Riches come, if they come at
all, in response to definite demands, based upon the application of definite
principles, and not by chance or luck. Generally speaking, an idea is an impulse
of thought that impels action, by an appeal to the imagination. All master
salesmen know that ideas can be sold where merchandise cannot. Ordinary
salesmen do not know this—that is why they are "ordinary."
A publisher of books, which sell for a nickel, made a discovery that should
be worth much to publishers generally. He learned that many people buy titles,
and not contents of books. By merely changing the name of one book that was
not moving, his sales on that book jumped upward more than a million copies.
The inside of the book was not changed in any way. He merely ripped off the
cover bearing the title that did not sell, and put on a new cover with a title that
had "box-office" value.
That, as simple as it may seem, was an IDEA! It was IMAGINATION.
There is no standard price on ideas. The creator of ideas makes his own
price, and, if he is smart, gets it.
The moving picture industry created a whole flock of millionaires. Most of
them were men who couldn't create ideas— BUT— they had the imagination to
recognize ideas when they saw them.
The next flock of millionaires will grow out of the radio business, which is
new and not overburdened with men of keen imagination. The money will be
made by those who discover or create new and more meritorious radio
programmes and have the imagination to recognize merit, and to give the radio
listeners a chance to profit by it.

The sponsor! That unfortunate victim who now pays the cost of all radio
"entertainment," soon will become idea conscious, and demand something for his
money. The man who beats the sponsor to the draw, and supplies programmes
that render useful service, is the man who will become rich in this new industry.
Crooners and light chatter artists who now pollute the air with wisecracks
and silly giggles, will go the way of all light timbers, and their places will be
taken by real artists who interpret carefully planned programmes which have
been designed to service the minds of men, as well as provide entertainment.
Here is a wide open field of opportunity screaming its protest at the way it
is being butchered, because of lack of imagination, and begging for rescue at any
price. Above all, the thing that radio needs is new IDEAS!
If this new field of opportunity intrigues you, perhaps you might profit by
the suggestion that the successful radio programmes of the future will give more
attention to creating "buyer" audiences, and less attention to "listener" audiences.
Stated more plainly, the builder of radio programmes who succeeds in the
future, must find practical ways to convert "listeners" into "buyers." Moreover,
the successful producer of radio programmes in the future must key his features
so that he can definitely show its effect upon the audience.
Sponsors are becoming a bit weary of buying glib selling talks, based
upon statements grabbed out of thin air. They want, and in the future will
demand, indisputable proof that the Whoosit programme not only gives millions
of people the silliest giggle ever, but that the silly giggler can sell merchandise!
Another thing that might as well be understood by those who contemplate
entering this new field of opportunity, radio advertising is going to be handled
by an entirely new group of advertising experts, separate and distinct from the
old time newspaper and magazine advertising agency men. The old timers in the
advertising game cannot read the modern radio scripts, because they have been
schooled to SEE ideas. The new radio technique demands men who can interpret
ideas from a written manuscript in terms of SOUND! It cost the author a year of
hard labor, and many thousands of dollars to learn this.
Radio, right now, is about where the moving pictures were, when Mary
Pickford and her curls first appeared on the screen. There is plenty of room in
radio for those who can produce or recognize IDEAS.
If the foregoing comment on the opportunities of radio has not started
your idea factory to work, you had better forget it. Your opportunity is in some
other field. If the comment intrigued you in the slightest degree, then go further
into it, and you may find the one IDEA you need to round out your career.

Never let it discourage you if you have no experience in radio. Andrew
Carnegie knew very little about making steel— I have Carnegie's own word for
this—but he made practical use of two of the principles described in this book,
and made the steel business yield him a fortune.
The story of practically every great fortune starts with the day when a
creator of ideas and a seller of ideas got together and worked in harmony.
Carnegie surrounded himself with men who could do all that he could not do.
Men who created ideas, and men who put ideas into operation, and made
himself and the others fabulously rich.
Millions of people go through life hoping for favorable "breaks." Perhaps a
favorable break can get one an opportunity, but the safest plan is not to depend
upon luck. It was a favorable "break" that gave me the biggest opportunity of my
life— but— twenty-five years of determined effort had to be devoted to that
opportunity before it became an asset.
The "break" consisted of my good fortune in meeting and gaining the
cooperation of Andrew Carnegie. On that occasion Carnegie planted in my mind
the idea of organizing the principles of achievement into a philosophy of success.
Thousands of people have profited by the discoveries made in the twenty-five
years of research, and several fortunes have been accumulated through the
application of the philosophy. The beginning was simple. It was an IDEA which
anyone might have developed.
The favorable break came through Carnegie, but what about the
DETERMINATION, DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE, and the DESIRE TO
ATTAIN THE GOAL, and the PERSISTENT EFFORT OF TWENTY-FIVE
YEARS? It was no ordinary DESIRE that survived disappointment,
discouragement, temporary defeat, criticism, and the constant reminding of
"waste of time." It was a BURNING DESIRE! AN OBSESSION!
When the idea was first planted in my mind by Mr. Carnegie, it was
coaxed, nursed, and enticed to remain alive. Gradually, the idea became a giant
under its own power, and it coaxed, nursed, and drove me. Ideas are like that.
First you give life and action and guidance to ideas, then they take on power of
their own and sweep aside all opposition.
Ideas are intangible forces, but they have more power than the physical
brains that give birth to them. They have the power to live on, after the brain that
creates them has returned to dust. For example, take the power of Christianity.
That began with a simple idea, born in the brain of Christ. Its chief tenet was, "do
unto others as you would have others do unto you." Christ has gone back to the

source from whence He came, but His IDEA goes marching on. Some day, it may
grow up, and come into its own, then it will have fulfilled Christ's deepest
DESIRE. The IDEA has been developing only two thousand years. Give it time!


SUCCESS REQUIRES NO EXPLANATIONS

FAILURE PERMITS NO ALIBIS


CHAPTER 7
ORGANIZED PLANNING
THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF DESIRE INTO ACTION
The Sixth Step toward Riches
You have learned that everything man creates or acquires, begins in the
form of DESIRE, that desire is taken on the first lap of its journey, from the
abstract to the concrete, into the workshop of the IMAGINATION, where PLANS
for its transition are created and organized.
In Chapter two, you were instructed to take six definite, practical steps, as
your first move in translating the desire for money into its monetary equivalent.
One of these steps is the formation of a DEFINITE, practical plan, or plans,
through which this transformation may be made. You will now be instructed
how to build plans which will be practical, viz:—
(a) Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the
creation, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of money
— making use of the "Master Mind" principle described in a later chapter.
(Compliance with this instruction is absolutely essential. Do not neglect it.)
(b) Before forming your "Master Mind" alliance, decide what advantages,
and benefits, you may offer the individual members of your group, in return for
their cooperation. No one will work indefinitely without some form of
compensation. No intelligent person will either request or expect another to
work without adequate compensation, although this may not always be in the
form of money.
(c) Arrange to meet with the members of your "Master Mind" group at
least twice a week, and more often if possible, until you have jointly perfected
the necessary plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.


(d) Maintain PERFECT HARMONY between yourself and every member
of your "Master Mind" group. If you fail to carry out this instruction to the letter,
you may expect to meet with failure. The "Master Mind" principle cannot obtain
where PERFECT HARMONY does not prevail.
Keep in mind these facts:—
First. You are engaged in an undertaking of major importance to you. To be sure
of success, you must have plans which are faultless.
Second. You must have the advantage of the experience, education, native ability
and imagination of other minds. This is in harmony with the methods followed
by every person who has accumulated a great fortune.
No individual has sufficient experience, education, native ability, and
knowledge to insure the accumulation of a great fortune, without the
cooperation of other people. Every plan you adopt, in your endeavor to
accumulate wealth, should be the joint creation of yourself and every other
member of your "Master Mind" group. You may originate your own plans, either
in whole or in part, but SEE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE CHECKED, AND
APPROVED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR "MASTER MIND" ALLIANCE.
If the first plan which you adopt does not work successfully, replace it
with a new plan, if this new plan fails to work, replace it, in turn with still
another, and so on, until you find a plan which DOES WORK. Right here is the
point at which the majority of men meet with failure, because of their lack of
PERSISTENCE in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.
The most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating money—
nor in any other undertaking— without plans which are practical and workable.
Just keep this fact in mind, and remember when your plans fail, that temporary
defeat is not permanent failure. It may only mean that your plans have not been
sound. Build other plans. Start all over again.
Thomas A. Edison "failed" ten thousand times before he perfected the
incandescent electric light bulb. That is— he met with temporary defeat ten
thousand times, before his efforts were crowned with success.
Temporary defeat should mean only one thing, the certain knowledge that
there is something wrong with your plan. Millions of men go through life in
misery and poverty, because they lack a sound plan through which to
accumulate a fortune.

Henry Ford accumulated a fortune, not because of his superior mind, but
because he adopted and followed a PLAN which proved to be sound. A
thousand men could be pointed out, each with a better education than Ford's, yet
each of whom lives in poverty, because he does not possess the RIGHT plan for
the accumulation of money.
Your achievement can be no greater than your PLANS are sound. That
may seem to be an axiomatic statement, but it is true. Samuel Insull lost his
fortune of over one hundred million dollars. The Insull fortune was built on
plans which were sound. The business depression forced Mr. Insull to CHANGE
HIS PLANS; and the CHANGE brought "temporary defeat," because his new
plans were NOT SOUND. Mr. Insull is now an old man, he may, consequently,
accept "failure" instead of "temporary defeat," but if his experience turns out to
be FAILURE, it will be for the reason that he lacks the fire of PERSISTENCE to
rebuild his plans.
No man is ever whipped, until he QUITS— in his own mind.
This fact will be repeated many times, because it is so easy to "take the
count" at the first sign of defeat.
James J. Hill met with temporary defeat when he first endeavored to raise
the necessary capital to build a railroad from the East to the West, but he, too
turned defeat into victory through new plans.
Henry Ford met with temporary defeat, not only at the beginning of his
automobile career, but after he had gone far toward the top. He created new
plans, and went marching on to financial victory.
We see men who have accumulated great fortunes, but we often recognize
only their triumph, overlooking the temporary defeats which they had to
surmount before "arriving."
NO FOLLOWER OF THIS PHILOSOPHY CAN REASONABLY EXPECT
TO ACCUMULATE A FORTUNE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING "TEMPORARY
DEFEAT." When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound,
rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal. If you give
up before your goal has been reached, you are a "quitter."
A QUITTER NEVER WINS—AND— A WINNER NEVER QUITS.
Lift this sentence out, write it on a piece of paper in letters an inch high,
and place it where you will see it every night before you go to sleep, and every
morning before you go to work.
When you begin to select members for your "Master Mind" group,
endeavor to select those who do not take defeat seriously.

Some people foolishly believe that only MONEY can make money. This is
not true! DESIRE, transmuted into its monetary equivalent, through the
principles laid down here, is the agency through which money is "made." Money,
of itself, is nothing but inert matter. It cannot move, think, or talk, but it can
"hear" when a man who DESIRES it, calls it to come!
PLANNING THE SALE OF SERVICES
The remainder of this chapter has been given over to a description of ways
and means of marketing personal services. The information here conveyed will
be of practical help to any person having any form of personal services to
market, but it will be of priceless benefit to those who aspire to leadership in
their chosen occupations.
Intelligent planning is essential for success in any undertaking designed to
accumulate riches. Here will be found detailed instructions to those who must
begin the accumulation of riches by selling personal services.
It should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes
began in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of
IDEAS. What else, except ideas and personal services, would one not possessed
of property have to give in return for riches?
Broadly speaking, there are two types of people in the world. One type is
known as LEADERS, and the other as FOLLOWERS. Decide at the outset
whether you intend to become a leader in your chosen calling, or remain a
follower. The difference in compensation is vast. The follower cannot reasonably
expect the compensation to which a leader is entitled, although many followers
make the mistake of expecting such pay.
It is no disgrace to be a follower. On the other hand, it is no credit to
remain a follower. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They
became great leaders because they were INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS. With few
exceptions, the man who cannot follow a leader intelligently, cannot become an
efficient leader. The man who can follow a leader most efficiently, is usually the
man who develops into leadership most rapidly. An intelligent follower has
many advantages, among them the OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE
KNOWLEDGE FROM HIS LEADER.
THE MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP


The following are important factors of leadership:—
1. UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's
occupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks selfconfidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a
leader very long.
2. SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never
control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the
more intelligent will emulate.
3. A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no
leader can command and retain the respect of his followers.
4. DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions,
shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.
5. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work,
and work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite
plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on
the rocks.
6. THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties
of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do
more than he requires of his followers.
7. A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become
a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a
leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality.
8. SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be
in sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their
problems.
9. MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of
details of the leader's position.


10. WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful
leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the
shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not
remain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself
incompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed.
11. COOPERATION. The successful leader must understand, and apply
the principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the
same. Leadership calls for POWER, and power calls for COOPERATION.
There are two forms of Leadership. The first, and by far the most effective,
is LEADERSHIP BY CONSENT of, and with the sympathy of the followers. The
second is LEADERSHIP BY FORCE, without the consent and sympathy of the
followers.
History is filled with evidences that Leadership by Force cannot endure.
The downfall and disappearance of "Dictators" and kings is significant. It means
that people will not follow forced leadership indefinitely.
The world has just entered a new era of relationship between leaders and
followers, which very clearly calls for new leaders, and a new brand of
leadership in business and industry. Those who belong to the old school of
leadership-by-force, must acquire an understanding of the new brand of
leadership (cooperation) or be relegated to the rank and file of the followers.
There is no other way out for them.
The relationship of employer and employee, or of leader and follower, in
the future, will be one of mutual cooperation, based upon an equitable division
of the profits of business. In the future, the relationship of employer and
employee will be more like a partnership than it has been in the past.
Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, the Czar of Russia, and the King
of Spain were examples of leadership by force. Their leadership passed. Without
much difficulty, one might point to the prototypes of these ex-leaders, among the
business, financial, and labor leaders of America who have been dethroned or
slated to go. Leadership-by-consent of the followers is the only brand which can
endure!
Men may follow the forced leadership temporarily, but they will not do so
willingly.
The new brand of LEADERSHIP will embrace the eleven factors of
leadership, described in this chapter, as well as some other factors. The man who

makes these the basis of his leadership, will find abundant opportunity to lead in
any walk of life. The depression was prolonged, largely, because the world
lacked LEADERSHIP of the new brand. At the end of the depression, the
demand for leaders who are competent to apply the new methods of leadership
has greatly exceeded the supply. Some of the old type of leaders will reform and
adapt themselves to the new brand of leadership, but generally speaking, the
world will have to look for new timber for its leadership. This necessity may be
your OPPORTUNITY!
THE 10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP
We come now to the major faults of leaders who fail, because it is just as
essential to know WHAT NOT TO DO as it is to know what to do.
1. INABILITY TO ORGANIZE DETAILS. Efficient
leadership calls for ability to organize and to master details. No
genuine leader is ever "too busy" to do anything which may be
required of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he
is a leader or follower, admits that he is "too busy" to change his
plans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his
inefficiency. The successful leader must be the master of all details
connected with his position. That means, of course, that he must
acquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants.
2. UNWILLINGNESS TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE.
Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform
any sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. "The
greatest among ye shall be the servant of all" is a truth which all
able leaders observe and respect.
3. EXPECTATION OF PAY FOR WHAT THEY "KNOW"
INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY
KNOW. The world does not pay men for that which they "know." It
pays them for what they DO, or induce others to do.
4. FEAR OF COMPETITION FROM FOLLOWERS. The
leader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is

practically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader
trains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the
details of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply
himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give
attention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men
receive more pay for their ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO
PERFORM, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An
efficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the
magnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of
others, and induce them to render more service and better service
than they could render without his aid.
5. LACK OF IMAGINATION. Without imagination, the
leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans
by which to guide his followers efficiently.
6. SELFISHNESS. The leader who claims all the honor for the
work of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really
great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to
see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he
knows that most men will work harder for commendation and
recognition than they will for money alone.
7. INTEMPERANCE. Followers do not respect an
intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various
forms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in
it.
8. DISLOYALTY. Perhaps this should have come at the head
of the list. The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his
associates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long
maintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the
dust of the earth, and brings down on one's head the contempt he
deserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in
every walk of life.


9. EMPHASIS OF THE "AUTHORITY" OF LEADERSHIP.
The efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instil
fear in the hearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress
his followers with his "authority" comes within the category of
leadership through FORCE. If a leader is a REAL LEADER, he will
have no need to advertise that fact except by his conduct— his
sympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he
knows his job.
10. EMPHASIS OF TITLE. The competent leader requires no
"title" to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes
too much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The
doors to the office of the real leader are open to all who wish to
enter, and his working quarters are free from formality or
ostentation.
These are among the more common of the causes of failure in leadership.
Any one of these faults is sufficient to induce failure. Study the list carefully if
you aspire to leadership, and make sure that you are free of these faults.
SOME FERTILE FIELDS IN WHICH "NEW LEADERSHIP" WILL
BE REQUIRED
Before leaving this chapter, your attention is called to a few of the fertile
fields in which there has been a decline of leadership, and in which the new type
of leader may find an abundance of OPPORTUNITY.
First. In the field of politics there is a most insistent demand
for new leaders; a demand which indicates nothing less than an
emergency. The majority of politicians have, seemingly, become
high-grade, legalized racketeers. They have increased taxes and
debauched the machinery of industry and business until the people
can no longer stand the burden.
Second. The banking business is undergoing a reform. The
leaders in this field have almost entirely lost the confidence of the


public. Already the bankers have sensed the need of reform, and
they have begun it.
Third. Industry calls for new leaders. The old type of leaders
thought and moved in terms of dividends instead of thinking and
moving in terms of human equations! The future leader in industry,
to endure, must regard himself as a quasi-public official whose
duty it is to manage his trust in such a way that it will work
hardship on no individual, or group of individuals. Exploitation of
working men is a thing of the past. Let the man who aspires to
leadership in the field of business, industry, and labor remember
this.
Fourth. The religious leader of the future will be forced to
give more attention to the temporal needs of his followers, in the
solution of their economic and personal problems of the present,
and less attention to the dead past, and the yet unborn future.
Fifth. In the professions of law, medicine, and education, a
new brand of leadership, and to some extent, new leaders will
become a necessity. This is especially true in the field of education.
The leader in that field must, in the future, find ways and means of
teaching people HOW TO APPLY the knowledge they receive in
school. He must deal more with PRACTICE and less with
THEORY.
Sixth. New leaders will be required in the field of
Journalism. Newspapers of the future, to be conducted
successfully, must be divorced from "special privilege" and relieved
from the subsidy of advertising. They must cease to be organs of
propaganda for the interests which patronize their advertising
columns. The type of newspaper which publishes scandal and lewd
pictures will eventually go the way of all forces which debauch the
human mind.
These are but a few of the fields in which opportunities for new leaders
and a new brand of leadership are now available. The world is undergoing a

rapid change. This means that the media through which the changes in human
habits are promoted, must be adapted to the changes. The media here described,
are the ones which, more than any others, determine the trend of civilization.
WHEN AND HOW TO APPLY FOR A POSITION
The information described here is the net result of many years of
experience during which thousands of men and women were helped to market
their services effectively. It can, therefore, be relied upon as sound and practical.
MEDIA THROUGH WHICH SERVICES MAY BE
MARKETED
Experience has proved that the following media offer the most direct and
effective methods of bringing the buyer and seller of personal services together.
1. EMPLOYMENT BUREAUS. Care must be taken to select only reputable
bureaus, the management of which can show adequate records of achievement of
satisfactory results. There are comparatively few such bureaus.
2. ADVERTISING in newspapers, trade journals, magazines, and radio.
Classified advertising may usually be relied upon to produce satisfactory results
in the case of those who apply for clerical or ordinary salaried positions. Display
advertising is more desirable in the case of those who seek executive connections,
the copy to appear in the section of the paper which is most apt to come to the
attention of the class of employer being sought. The copy should be prepared by
an expert, who understands how to inject sufficient selling qualities to produce
replies.
3. PERSONAL LETTERS OF APPLICATION, directed to particular firms
or individuals most apt to need such services as are being offered. Letters should
be neatly typed, ALWAYS, and signed by hand. With the letter, should be sent a
complete "brief" or outline of the applicant's qualifications. Both the letter of
application and the brief of experience or qualifications should be prepared by an
expert. (See instructions as to information to be supplied).


4. APPLICATION THROUGH PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCES. When
possible, the applicant should endeavor to approach prospective employers
through some mutual acquaintance. This method of approach is particularly
advantageous in the case of those who seek executive connections and do not
wish to appear to be "peddling" themselves.
5. APPLICATION IN PERSON. In some instances, it may be more
effective if the applicant offers personally, his services to prospective employers,
in which event a complete written statement of qualifications for the position
should be presented, for the reason that prospective employers often wish to
discuss with associates, one's record.
INFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED IN A WRITTEN "BRIEF"
This brief should be prepared as carefully as a lawyer would prepare the
brief of a case to be tried m court. Unless the applicant is experienced in the
preparation of such briefs, an expert should be consulted, and his services
enlisted for this purpose. Successful merchants employ men and women who
understand the art and the psychology of advertising to present the merits of
their merchandise. One who has personal services for sale should do the same.
The following information should appear in the brief:
1. Education. State briefly, but definitely, what schooling you have had,
and in what subjects you specialized in school, giving the reasons for that
specialization.
2. Experience. If you have had experience in connection with positions
similar to the one you seek, describe it fully, state names and addresses of former
employers. Be sure to bring out clearly any special experience you may have had
which would equip you to fill the position you seek.
3. References. Practically every business firm desires to know all about the
previous records, antecedents, etc., of prospective employees who seek positions
of responsibility. Attach to your brief photostatic copies of letters from:
a. Former employers
b. Teachers under whom you studied

c. Prominent people whose judgement may be relied upon.
4. Photograph of self. Attach to your brief a recent, unmounted photograph
of yourself.
5. Apply for a specific position. Avoid application for a position without
describing EXACTLY what particular position you seek. Never apply for "just a
position." That indicates you lack specialized qualifications.
6. State your qualifications for the particular position for which you apply.
Give full details as to the reason you believe you are qualified for the particular
position you seek. This is THE APPLICATION. It will determine, more than
anything else, what consideration you receive.
7. Offer to go to work on probation. In the majority of instances if you are
determined to have the position for which you apply, it will be most effective if
you offer to work for a week, or a month, or for a sufficient length of time to
enable your prospective employer to judge your value WITHOUT PAY. This
may appear to be a radical suggestion, but experience has proved that it seldom
fails to win at least a trial. If you are SURE OF YOUR QUALIFICATIONS, a trial
is all you need. Incidentally, such an offer indicates that you have confidence in
your ability to fill the position you seek. It is most convincing. If your offer is
accepted, and you make good, more than likely you will be paid for your
"probation" period. Make clear the fact that your offer is based upon:
a. Your confidence in your ability to fill the position.
b. Your confidence in your prospective employer's decision
to employ you after trial.
c. Your DETERMINATION to have the position you seek.
8. Knowledge of your prospective employer's business. Before applying for a
position, do sufficient research in connection with the business to familiarize
yourself thoroughly with that business, and indicate in your brief the knowledge
you have acquired in this field. This will be impressive, as it will indicate that
you have imagination, and a real interest in the position you seek.


Remember that it is not the lawyer who knows the most law, but the one
who best prepares his case, who wins. If your "case" is properly prepared and
presented, your victory will have been more than half won at the outset.
Do not be afraid of making your brief too long. Employers are just as
much interested in purchasing the services of well-qualified applicants as you are
in securing employment. In fact, the success of most successful employers is due,
in the main, to their ability to select well-qualified lieutenants. They want all the
information available.
Remember another thing; neatness in the preparation of your brief will
indicate that you are a painstaking person. I have helped to prepare briefs for
clients which were so striking and out of the ordinary that they resulted in the
employment of the applicant without a personal interview.
When your brief has been completed, have it neatly bound by an
experienced binder, and lettered by an artist, or printer similar to the following:
BRIEF OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF
Robert K. Smith
APPLYING FOR THE POSITION OF
Private Secretary to The President of
THE BLANK COMPANY, Inc.
Change names each time brief is shown.
This personal touch is sure to command attention. Have your brief neatly
typed or mimeographed on the finest paper you can obtain, and bound with a
heavy paper of the book-cover variety, the binder to be changed, and the proper
firm name to be inserted if it is to be shown to more than one company. Your
photograph should be pasted on one of the pages of your brief. Follow these
instructions to the letter, improving upon them wherever your imagination
suggests.
Successful salesmen groom themselves with care. They understand that
first impressions are lasting. Your brief is your salesman. Give it a good suit of
clothes, so it will stand out in bold contrast to anything your prospective
employer ever saw, in the way of an application for a position. If the position you
seek is worth having, it is worth going after with care. Moreover, if you sell
yourself to an employer in a manner that impresses him with your individuality,
you probably will receive more money for your services from the very start, than
you would if you applied for employment in the usual conventional way.

If you seek employment through an advertising agency, or an
employment agency, have the agent use copies of your brief in marketing your
services. This will help to gain preference for you, both with the agent, and the
prospective employers.
HOW TO GET THE EXACT POSITION YOU DESIRE
Everyone enjoys doing the kind of work for which he is best suited. An
artist loves to work with paints, a craftsman with his hands, a writer loves to
write. Those with less definite talents have their preferences for certain fields of
business and industry. If America does anything well, it offers a full range of
occupations, tilling the soil, manufacturing, marketing, and the professions.
First. Decide EXACTLY what kind of a job you want. If the job doesn't
already exist, perhaps you can create it.
Second. Choose the company, or individual for whom you wish to work.
Third. Study your prospective employer, as to policies, personnel, and
chances of advancement.
Fourth. By analysis of yourself, your talents and capabilities, figure
WHAT YOU CAN OFFER, and plan ways and means of giving advantages,
services, developments, ideas that you believe you can successfully deliver.
Fifth. Forget about "a job." Forget whether or not there is an opening.
Forget the usual routine of "have you got a job for me?" Concentrate on what you
can give.
Sixth. Once you have your plan in mind, arrange with an experienced
writer to put it on paper in neat form, and in full detail.
Seventh. Present it to the proper person with authority and he will do the
rest. Every company is looking for men who can give something of value,
whether it be ideas, services, or "connections." Every company has room for the
man who has a definite plan of action which is to the advantage of that company.


This line of procedure may take a few days or weeks of extra time, but the
difference in income, in advancement, and in gaining recognition will save years
of hard work at small pay. It has many advantages, the main one being that it
will often save from one to five years of time in reaching a chosen goal.
Every person who starts, or "gets in" half way up the ladder, does so by
deliberate and careful planning, (excepting, of course, the Boss' son).
THE NEW WAY OF MARKETING SERVICES "JOBS"
ARE NOW "PARTNERSHIPS"
Men and women who market their services to best advantage in the
future, must recognize the stupendous change which has taken place in
connection with the relationship between employer and employee.
In the future, the "Golden Rule," and not the "Rule of Gold" will be the
dominating factor in the marketing of merchandise as well as personal services.
The future relationship between employers and their employees will be more in
the nature of a partnership consisting of:
a. The employer
b. The employee
c. The public they serve
This new way of marketing personal services is called new for many
reasons, first, both the employer and the employee of the future will be
considered as fellow-employees whose business it will be to SERVE THE
PUBLIC EFFICIENTLY. In times past, employers, and employees have bartered
among themselves, driving the best bargains they could with one another, not
considering that in the final analysis they were, in reality, BARGAINING AT
THE EXPENSE OF THE THIRD PARTY, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVED.
The depression served as a mighty protest from an injured public, whose
rights had been trampled upon in every direction by those who were clamoring
for individual advantages and profits. When the debris of the depression shall
have been cleared away, and business shall have been once again restored to
balance, both employers and employees will recognize that they are NO
LONGER PRIVILEGED TO DRIVE BARGAINS AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE
WHOM THEY SERVE. The real employer of the future will be the public. This
should be kept uppermost in mind by every person seeking to market personal
services effectively.


Nearly every railroad in America is in financial difficulty. Who does not
remember the day when, if a citizen enquired at the ticket office, the time of
departure of a train, he was abruptly referred to the bulletin board instead of
being politely given the information?
The street car companies have experienced a "change of times" also. There
was a time not so very long ago when street car conductors took pride in giving
argument to passengers. Many of the street car tracks have been removed and
passengers ride on a bus, whose driver is "the last word in politeness."
All over the country street car tracks are rusting from abandonment, or
have been taken up. Whereever street cars are still in operation, passengers may
now ride without argument, and one may even hail the car in the middle of the
block, and the motorman will OBLIGINGLY pick him up.
HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED! That is just the point I am trying to
emphasize. TIMES HAVE CHANGED! Moreover, the change is reflected not
merely in railroad offices and on street cars, but in other walks of life as well. The
"public-be-damned" policy is now passé. It has been supplanted by the "we-areobligingly-at-your-service, sir," policy.
The bankers have learned a thing or two during this rapid change which
has taken place during the past few years. Impoliteness on the part of a bank
official, or bank employee today is as rare as it was conspicuous a dozen years
ago. In the years past, some bankers (not all of them, of course), carried an
atmosphere of austerity which gave every would-be borrower a chill when he
even thought of approaching his banker for a loan.
The thousands of bank failures during the depression had the effect of
removing the mahogany doors behind which bankers formerly barricaded
themselves. They now sit at desks in the open, where they may be seen and
approached at will by any depositor, or by anyone who wishes to see them, and
the whole atmosphere of the bank is one of courtesy and understanding.
It used to be customary for customers to have to stand and wait at the
corner grocery until the clerks were through passing the time of day with friends,
and the proprietor had finished making up his bank deposit, before being waited
upon. Chain stores, managed by COURTEOUS MEN who do everything in the
way of service, short of shining the customer's shoes, have PUSHED THE OLDTIME MERCHANTS INTO THE BACKGROUND. TIME MARCHES ON!
"Courtesy" and "Service" are the watch-words of merchandising today,
and apply to the person who is marketing personal services even more directly
than to the employer whom he serves, because, in the final analysis, both the

employer and his employee are EMPLOYED BY THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE. If
they fail to serve well, they pay by the loss of their privilege of serving.
We can all remember the time when the gas-meter reader pounded on the
door hard enough to break the panels. When the door was opened, he pushed his
way in, uninvited, with a scowl on his face which plainly said, "what-the-helldid-you-keep-me-waiting- for?" All that has undergone a change. The meter-man
now conducts himself as a gentleman who is "delighted-to-be-at-your-servicesir." Before the gas companies learned that their scowling meter-men were
accumulating liabilities never to be cleared away, the polite salesmen of oil
burners came along and did a land office business.
During the depression, I spent several months in the anthracite coal region
of Pennsylvania, studying conditions which all but destroyed the coal industry.
Among several very significant discoveries, was the fact that greed on the part of
operators and their employees was the chief cause of the loss of business for the
operators, and loss of jobs for the miners.
Through the pressure of a group of overzealous labor leaders,
representing the employees, and the greed for profits on the part of the
operators, the anthracite business suddenly dwindled. The coal operators and
their employees drove sharp bargains with one another, adding the cost of the
"bargaining" to the price of the coal, until, finally, they discovered they had
BUILT UP A WONDERFUL BUSINESS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS OF OIL
BURNING OUTFITS AND THE PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL.
"The wages of sin is death!" Many have read this in the Bible, but few have
discovered its meaning. Now, and for several years, the entire world has been
listening BY FORCE, to a sermon which might well be called "WHATSOEVER A
MAN SOWETH, THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP."
Nothing as widespread and effective as the depression could possibly be
"just a coincidence." Behind the depression was a CAUSE. Nothing ever happens
without a CAUSE. In the main, the cause of the depression is traceable directly to
the worldwide habit of trying to REAP without SOWING.
This should not be mistaken to mean that the depression represents a crop
which the world is being FORCED to reap without having SOWN. The trouble is
that the world sowed the wrong sort of seed. Any farmer knows he cannot sow the
seed of thistles, and reap a harvest of grain. Beginning at the outbreak of the
world war, the people of the world began to sow the seed of service inadequate
in both quality and quantity. Nearly everyone was engaged in the pastime of
trying to GET WITHOUT GIVING.

These illustrations are brought to the attention of those who have personal
services to market, to show that we are where we are, and what we are, because of
our own conduct! If there is a principle of cause and effect, which controls
business, finance, and transportation, this same principle controls individuals
and determines their economic status.
WHAT IS YOUR "QQS" RATING?
The causes of success in marketing services EFFECTIVELY and
permanently, have been clearly described. Unless those causes are studied,
analyzed, understood and APPLIED, no man can market his services effectively
and permanently. Every person must be his own salesman of personal services.
The QUALITY and the QUANTITY of service rendered, and the SPIRIT in which
it is rendered, determine to a large extent, the price, and the duration of
employment. To market Personal services effectively, (which means a permanent
market, at a satisfactory price, under pleasant conditions), one must adopt and
follow the "QQS" formula which means that QUALITY, plus QUANTITY, plus
the proper SPIRIT of cooperation, equals perfect salesmanship of service.
Remember the "QQS" formula, but do more—APPLY IT AS A HABIT!
Let us analyze the formula to make sure we understand exactly what it
means.
1. QUALITY of service shall be construed to mean the performance of
every detail, in connection with your position, in the most efficient manner
possible, with the object of greater efficiency always in mind.
2. QUANTITY of service shall be understood to mean the HABIT of
rendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose
of increasing the amount of service rendered as greater skill is developed
through practice and experience. Emphasis is again placed on the word HABIT.
3. SPIRIT of service shall be construed to mean the HABIT of agreeable,
armonious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow
employees.
Adequacy of QUALITY and QUANTITY of service is not sufficient to
maintain a permanent market for your services. The conduct, or the SPIRIT in
which you deliver service, is a strong determining factor in connection with both
the price you receive, and the duration of employment.

Andrew Carnegie stressed this point more than others in connection with
his description of the factors which lead to success in the marketing of personal
services. He emphasized again, and again, the necessity for HARMONIOUS
CONDUCT. He stressed the fact that he would not retain any man, no matter
how great a QUANTITY, or how efficient the QUALITY of his work, unless he
worked in a spirit of HARMONY. Mr. Carnegie insisted upon men being
AGREEABLE.
To prove that he placed a high value upon this quality, he permitted many
men who conformed to his standards to become very wealthy. Those who did not
conform, had to make room for others.
The importance of a pleasing personality has been stressed, because it is a
factor which enables one to render service in the proper SPIRIT. If one has a
personality which PLEASES, and renders service in a spirit of HARMONY, these
assets often make up for deficiencies in both the QUALITY, and the QUANTITY
of service one renders. Nothing, however, can be SUCCESSFULLY
SUBSTITUTED FOR PLEASING CONDUCT.
THE CAPITAL VALUE OF YOUR SERVICES
The person whose income is derived entirely from the sale of personal
services is no less a merchant than the man who sells commodities, and it might
well be added, such a person is subject to EXACTLY THE SAME RULES of
conduct as the merchant who sells merchandise.
This has been emphasized, because the majority of people who live by the
sale of personal services make the mistake of considering themselves free from
the rules of conduct, and the responsibilities attached to those who are engaged
in marketing commodities.
The new way of marketing services has practically forced both employer
and. employee into partnership alliances, through which both take into
consideration the rights of the third party, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE.
The day of the "go-getter" has passed. He has been supplanted by the "gogiver." High-pressure methods in business finally blew the lid off. There will
never be the need to put the lid back on, because, in the future, business will be
conducted by methods that will require no pressure.
The actual capital value of your brains may be determined by the amount
of income you can produce (by marketing your services). A fair estimate of the
capital value of your services may be made by multiplying your annual income

by sixteen and two-thirds, as it is reasonable to estimate that your annual income
represents six percent of your capital value. Money rents for 6% per annum.
Money is worth no more than brains. It is often worth much less.
Competent "brains," if effectively marketed, represent a much more
desirable form of capital than that which is required to conduct a business
dealing in commodities, because "brains" are a form of capital which cannot be
permanently depreciated through depressions, nor can this form of capital be
stolen or spent. Moreover, the money which is essential for the conduct of
business is as worthless as a sand dune, until it has been mixed with efficient
"brains."
THE THIRTY MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE
HOW MANY OF THESE ARE HOLDING YOU BACK?
Life's greatest tragedy consists of men and women who earnestly try, and
fail! The tragedy lies in the overwhelmingly large majority of people who fail, as
compared to the few who succeed.
I have had the privilege of analyzing several thousand men and women,
98% of whom were classed as "failures." There is something radically wrong with
a civilization, and a system of education, which permit 98% of the people to go
through life as failures. But I did not write this book for the purpose of
moralizing on the rights and wrongs of the world; that would require a book a
hundred times the size of this one.
My analysis work proved that there are thirty major reasons for failure,
and thirteen major principles through which people accumulate fortunes. In this
chapter, a description of the thirty major causes of failure will be given. As you
go over the list, check yourself by it, point by point, for the purpose of
discovering how many of these causes-of-failure stand between you and success.
1. UNFAVORABLE HEREDITARY BACKGROUND. There
is but little, if anything, which can be done for people who are born
with a deficiency in brain power. This philosophy offers but one
method of bridging this weakness— through the aid of the Master
Mind. Observe with profit, however, that this is the ONLY one of
the thirty causes of failure which may not be easily corrected by any
individual.


2. LACK OF A WELL-DEFINED PURPOSE IN LIFE. There is
no hope of success for the person who does not have a central
purpose, or definite goal at which to aim. Ninety-eight out of every
hundred of those whom I have analyzed, had no such aim. Perhaps
this was the
3. LACK OF AMBITION TO AIM ABOVE MEDIOCRITY.
We offer no hope for the person who is so indifferent as not to want
to get ahead in life, and who is not willing to pay the price.
4. INSUFFICIENT EDUCATION. This is a handicap which
may be overcome with comparative ease. Experience has proven
that the best-educated people are often those who are known as
"self-made," or self-educated. It takes more than a college degree to
make one a person of education. Any person who is educated is
one who has learned to get whatever he wants in life without
violating the rights of others. Education consists, not so much of
knowledge, but of knowledge effectively and persistently
APPLIED. Men are paid, not merely for what they know, but more
particularly for WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY
KNOW.
5. LACK OF SELF-DISCIPLINE. Discipline comes through
self-control. This means that one must control all negative qualities.
Before you can control conditions, you must first control yourself.
Self-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not
conquer self, you will be conquered by self. You may see at one and
the same time both your best friend and your greatest enemy, by
stepping in front of a mirror.
6. ILL HEALTH. No person may enjoy outstanding success
without good health. Many of the causes of ill health are subject to
mastery and control. These, in the main are:
a. Overeating of foods not conducive to health
b. Wrong habits of thought; giving expression to
negatives.
c. Wrong use of, and over indulgence in sex.
d. Lack of proper physical exercise
e. An inadequate supply of fresh air, due to improper
breathing.


7. UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES
DURING CHILDHOOD. "As the twig is bent, so shall the tree
grow." Most people who have criminal tendencies acquire them as
the result of bad environment, and improper associates during
childhood.
8. PROCRASTINATION. This is one of the most common
causes of failure. "Old Man Procrastination" stands within the
shadow of every human being, waiting his opportunity to spoil
one's chances of success. Most of us go through life as failures,
because we are waiting for the "time to be right" to start doing
something worthwhile. Do not wait. The time will never be "just
right." Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you
may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you
go along.
9. LACK OF PERSISTENCE. Most of us are good "starters"
but poor "finishers" of everything we begin. Moreover, people are
prone to give up at the first signs of defeat. There is no substitute
for PERSISTENCE. The person who makes PERSISTENCE his
watch-word, discovers that "Old Man Failure" finally becomes
tired, and makes his departure. Failure cannot cope with
PERSISTENCE.
10. NEGATIVE PERSONALITY. There is no hope of success
for the person who repels people through a negative personality.
Success comes through the application of POWER, and power is
attained through the cooperative efforts of other people. A negative
personality will not induce cooperation.
11. LACK OF CONTROLLED SEXUAL URGE. Sex energy is
the most powerful of all the stimuli which move people into
ACTION. Because it is the most powerful of the emotions, it must
be controlled, through transmutation, and converted into other
channels.
12. UNCONTROLLED DESIRE FOR "SOMETHING FOR
NOTHING." The gambling instinct drives millions of people to
failure. Evidence of this may be found in a study of the Wall Street
crash of '29, during which millions of people tried to make money
by gambling on stock margins.


13. LACK OF A WELL DEFINED POWER OF DECISION.
Men who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at
all, very slowly. Men who fail, reach decisions, if at all, very slowly,
and change them frequently, and quickly. Indecision and
procrastination are twin brothers. Where one is found, the other
may usually be found also. Kill off this pair before they completely
"hog-tie" you to the treadmill of FAILURE.
14. ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX BASIC FEARS. These fears
have been analyzed for you in a later chapter. They must be
mastered before you can market your services effectively.
15. WRONG SELECTION OF A MATE IN MARRIAGE. This
a most common cause of failure. The relationship of marriage
brings people intimately into contact. Unless this relationship is
harmonious, failure is likely to follow. Moreover, it will be a form
of failure that is marked by misery and unhappiness, destroying all
signs of AMBITION.
16. OVER-CAUTION. The person who takes no chances,
generally has to take whatever is left when others are through
choosing. Over-caution is as bad as under-caution. Both are
extremes to be guarded against. Life itself is filled with the element
of chance.
17. WRONG SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES IN BUSINESS.
This is one of the most common causes of failure in business. In
marketing personal services, one should use great care to select an
employer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself,
intelligent and successful. We emulate those with whom we
associate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth emulating.
18. SUPERSTITION AND PREJUDICE. Superstition is a
form of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep
open minds and are afraid of nothing.
19. WRONG SELECTION OF A VOCATION. No man can
succeed in a line of endeavor which he does not like. The most
essential step in the marketing of personal services is that of
selecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself
wholeheartedly.


20. LACK OF CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT. The "jack-ofall-trades" seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on
one DEFINITE CHIEF AIM.
21. THE HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING. The
spend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in
FEAR OF POVERTY. Form the habit of systematic saving by
putting aside a definite percentage of your income. Money in the
bank gives one a very safe foundation of COURAGE when bargaining for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must
take what one is offered, and be glad to get it.
22. LACK OF ENTHUSIASM. Without enthusiasm one
cannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the
person who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any
group of people.
23. INTOLERANCE. The person with a "closed" mmd on
any subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has
stopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging forms of
intolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and political
differences of opinion.
24. INTEMPERANCE. The most damaging forms of
intemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual
activities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success.
25. INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS. More
people lose their positions and their big opportunities in life,
because of this fault, than for all other reasons combined. It is a
fault which no well-informed business man, or leader will tolerate.
26. POSSESSION OF POWER THAT WAS NOT ACQUIRED
THROUGH SELF EFFORT. (Sons and daughters of wealthy men,
and others who inherit money which they did not earn). Power in
the hands of one who did not acquire it gradually, is often fatal to
success. QUICK RICHES are more dangerous than poverty.
27. INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY. There is no substitute for
honesty. One may be temporarily dishonest by force of
circumstances over which one has no control, without permanent
damage. But, there is NO HOPE for the person who is dishonest by
choice. Sooner or later, his deeds will catch up with him, and he
will pay by loss of reputation, and perhaps even loss of liberty.

28. EGOTISM AND VANITY. These qualities serve as red
lights which warn others to keep away. THEY ARE FATAL TO
SUCCESS.
29. GUESSING INSTEAD OF THINKING. Most people are
too indifferent or lazy to acquire FACTS with which to THINK
ACCURATELY. They prefer to act on "opinions" created by
guesswork or snap-judgments.
30. LACK OF CAPITAL. This is a common cause of failure
among those who start out in business for the first time, without
sufficient reserve of capital to absorb the shock of their mistakes,
and to carry them over until they have established a
REPUTATION.
31. Under this, name any particular cause of failure from
which you have suffered that has not been included in the
foregoing list.
In these thirty major causes of failure is found a description of the tragedy
of life, which obtains for practically every person who tries and fails. It will be
helpful if you can induce someone who knows you well to go over this list with
you, and help to analyze you by the thirty causes of failure. It may be beneficial if
you try this alone. Most people cannot see themselves as others see them. You
may be one who cannot.
The oldest of admonitions is "Man, know thyself!" If you market
merchandise successfully, you must know the merchandise. The same is true in
marketing personal services. You should know all of your weaknesses in order
that you may either bridge them or eliminate them entirely. You should know
your strength in order that you may call attention to it when selling your
services. You can know yourself only through accurate analysis.
The folly of ignorance in connection with self was displayed by a young
man who applied to the manager of a well known business for a position. He
made a very good impression until the manager asked him what salary he
expected. He replied that he had no fixed sum in mind (lack of a definite aim). The
manager then said, "We will pay you all you are worth, alter we try you out for a
week."
"I will not accept it," the applicant replied, "because I AM GETTING
MORE THAN THAT WHERE I AM NOW EMPLOYED."


Before you even start to negotiate for a readjustment of your salary in
your present position, or to seek employment elsewhere, BE SURE THAT YOU
ARE WORTH MORE THAN YOU NOW RECEIVE.
It is one thing to WANT money— everyone wants more—but it is
something entirely different to be WORTH MORE! Many people mistake their
WANTS for their JUST DUES. Your financial requirements or wants have
nothing whatever to do with your WORTH. Your value is established entirely by
your ability to render useful service or your capacity to induce others to render
such service.
TAKE INVENTORY OF YOURSELF
28 QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ANSWER
Annual self-analysis is an essential in the effective marketing of personal
services, as is annual inventory in merchandising. Moreover, the yearly analysis
should disclose a DECREASE IN FAULTS, and an increase in VIRTUES. One
goes ahead, stands still, or goes backward in life. One's object should be, of
course, to go ahead. Annual self-analysis will disclose whether advancement has
been, made, and if so, how much. It will also disclose any backward steps one
may have made. The effective marketing of personal services requires one to
move forward even if the progress is slow.
Your annual self-analysis should be made at the end of each year, so you
can include in your New Year's Resolutions any improvements which the
analysis indicates should be made. Take this inventory by asking yourself the
following questions, and by checking your answers with the aid of someone who
will not permit you to deceive yourself as to their accuracy.

Having read and assimilated the information conveyed through this
chapter, you are now ready to create a practical plan for marketing your personal
services. In this chapter will be found an adequate description of every principle
essential in planning the sale of personal services, including the major attributes
of leadership; the most common causes of failure in leadership; a description of
the fields of opportunity for leadership; the main causes of failure in all walks of
life, and the important questions which should be used in self-analysis. This
extensive and detailed presentation of accurate information has been included,
because it will be needed by all who must begin the accumulation of riches by
marketing personal services. Those who have lost their fortunes, and those who
are just beginning to earn money, have nothing but personal services to offer in
return for riches, therefore it is essential that they have available the practical
information needed to market services to best advantage.
The information contained in this chapter will be of great value to all who
aspire to attain leadership in any calling. It will be particularly helpful to those
aiming to market their services as business or industrial executives.
Complete assimilation and understanding of the information here
conveyed will be helpful in marketing one's own services, and it will also help
one to become more analytical and capable of judging people. The information
will be priceless to personnel directors, employment managers, and other
executives charged with the selection of employees, and the maintenance of
efficient organizations. If you doubt this statement, test its soundness by

answering in writing the twenty-eight self-analysis questions. That might be both
interesting and profitable, even though you do not doubt the soundness of the
statement.
WHERE AND HOW ONE MAY FIND OPPORTUNITIES
TO ACCUMULATE RICHES
Now that we have analyzed the principles by which riches may be
accumulated, we naturally ask, "where may one find favorable opportunities to
apply these principles?" Very well, let us take inventory and see what the United
States of America offer the person seeking riches, great or small.
To begin with, let us remember, all of us, that we live in a country where
every law-abiding citizen enjoys freedom of thought and freedom of deed unequaled
anywhere in the world. Most of us have never taken inventory of the advantages of
this freedom. We have never compared our unlimited freedom with the curtailed
freedom in other countries.
Here we have freedom of thought, freedom in the choice and enjoyment of
education, freedom in religion, freedom in politics, freedom in the choice of a
business, profession or occupation, freedom to accumulate and own without
molestation, ALL
THE PROPERTY WE CAN ACCUMULATE, freedom to choose our place
of residence, freedom in marriage, freedom through equal opportunity to all
races, freedom of travel from one state to another, freedom in our choice of foods,
and freedom
to AIM FOR ANY STATION IN LIFE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PREPARED
OURSELVES, even for the presidency of the United States.
We have other forms of freedom, but this list will give a bird's eye view of
the most important, which constitute OPPORTUNITY of the highest order. This
advantage of freedom is all the more conspicuous because the United States is
the only country guaranteeing to every citizen, whether native born or
naturalized, so broad and varied a list of freedom.
Next, let us recount some of the blessings which our widespread freedom
has placed within our hands. Take the average American family for example
(meaning, the family of average income) and sum up the benefits available to
every member of the family, in this land of OPPORTUNITY and plenty!


a. FOOD. Next to freedom of thought and deed comes FOOD,
CLOTHING, and SHELTER, the three basic necessities of life.
Because of our universal freedom the average American family has
available, at its very door, the choicest selection of food to be found
anywhere in the world, and at prices within its financial range.
A family of two, living in the heart of Times Square district of New
York City, far removed from the source of production of foods, took
careful inventory of the cost of a simple breakfast, with this astonishing
result:
Articles of food;
Cost at the breakfast table:
Grape Fruit Juice, (From Florida) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02
Rippled Wheat Breakfast food (Kansas Farm). . . . . . . . . 02
Tea (From China). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02
Bananas (From South America) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .02½
Toasted Bread (From Kansas Farm) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .01
Fresh Country Eggs (From Utah) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .07
Sugar (From Cuba, or Utah) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 00½
Butter and Cream (From New England) . . . . . . . . . . . . .03
Grand total . . . . . .20
It is not very difficult to obtain FOOD in a country where two people can
have breakfast consisting of all they want or need for a dime apiece! Observe that
this simple breakfast was gathered, by some strange form of magic (?) from
China, South America, Utah, Kansas and the New England States, and delivered
on the breakfast table, ready for consumption, in the very heart of the most
crowded city in America, at a cost well within the means of the most humble
laborer.
The cost included all federal, state and city taxes! (Here is a fact the
politicians did not mention when they were crying out to the voters to throw
their opponents out of office because the people were being taxed to death).
b. SHELTER. This family lives in a comfortable apartment, heated
by steam, lighted with electricity, with gas for cooking, all for $65.00 a
month. In a smaller city, or a more sparsely settled part of New York city,
the same apartment could be had for as low as $20.00 a month.


The toast they had for breakfast in the food estimate was toasted on
an electric toaster, which cost but a few dollars, the apartment is cleaned
with a vacuum sweeper that is run by electricity. Hot &nd cold water is
available, at all times, in the kitchen and the bathroom. The food is kept
cool in a refrigerator that is run by electricity. The wife curls her hair,
washes her clothes and irons them with easily operated electrical
equipment, on power obtained by sticking a plug in the wall. The husband
shaves with an electric shaver, and they receive entertainment from all
over the world, twenty four hours a day, if they want it, without cost, by
merely turning the dial of their radio.
There are other conveniences in this apartment, but the foregoing
list will give a fair idea of some of the concrete evidences of the freedom
we, of America, enjoy. (And this is neither political nor economic
propaganda).
c. CLOTHING. Anywhere in the United States, the woman of
average clothing requirements can dress very comfortably and neatly for
less than $200.00 a year, and the average man can dress for the same, or
less.
Only the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter have been
mentioned. The average American citizen has other privileges and advantages
available in return for modest effort, not exceeding eight hours per day of labor.
Among these is the privilege of automobile transportation, with which one can
go and come at will, at very small cost.
The average American has security of property rights not found in any
other country in the world. He can place his surplus money in a bank with the
assurance that his government will protect it, and make good to him if the bank
fails. If an American citizen wants to travel from one state to another he needs no
passport, no one's permission. He may go when he pleases, and return at will.
Moreover, he may travel by train, private automobile, bus, airplane, or ship, as
his pocketbook permits. In Germany, Russia, Italy, and most of the other
European and Oriental countries, the people cannot travel with so much
freedom, and at so little cost.
THE "MIRACLE" THAT HAS PROVIDED
THESE BLESSINGS

We often hear politicians proclaiming the freedom of America, when they
solicit votes, but seldom do they take the time or devote sufficient effort to the
analysis of the source or nature of this "freedom." Having no axe to grind, no
grudge to express, no ulterior motives to be carried out, I have the privilege of
going into a frank analysis of that mysterious, abstract, greatly misunderstood
"SOMETHING" which gives to every citizen of America more blessings, more
opportunities to accumulate wealth, more freedom of every nature, than may be
found in any other country.
I have the right to analyze the source and nature of this UNSEEN POWER,
because I know, and have known for more than a quarter of a century, many of
the men who organized that power, and many who are now responsible for its
maintenance.
The name of this mysterious benefactor of mankind is CAPITAL!
CAPITAL consists not alone of money, but more particularly of highly
organized, intelligent groups of men who plan ways and means of using money
efficiently for the good of the public, and profitably to themselves.
These groups consist of scientists, educators, chemists, inventors, business
analysts, publicity men, transportation experts, accountants, lawyers, doctors,
and both men and women who have highly specialized knowledge in all fields of
industry and business. They pioneer, experiment, and blaze trails in new fields of
endeavor. They support colleges, hospitals, public schools, build good roads,
publish newspapers, pay most of the cost of government, and take care of the
multitudinous detail essential to human progress. Stated briefly, the capitalists
are the brains of civilization, because they supply the entire fabric of which all
education, enlightenment and human progress consists.
Money, without brains, always is dangerous. Properly used, it is the most
important essential of civilization. The simple breakfast here described could not
have been delivered to the New York family at a dime each, or at any other price, if
organized capital had not provided the machinery, the ships, the railroads, and
the huge armies of trained men to operate them.
Some slight idea of the importance of ORGANIZED CAPITAL may be
had by trying to imagine yourself burdened with the responsibility of collecting,
without the aid of capital, and delivering to the New York City family, the
simple breakfast described.
To supply the tea, you would have to make a trip to China or India, both a
very long way from America. Unless you are an excellent swimmer, you would

become rather tired before making the round trip. Then, too, another problem
would confront you. What would you use for money, even if you had the
physical endurance to swim the ocean?
To supply the sugar, you would have to take another long swim to Cuba,
or a long walk to the sugar beet section of Utah. But even then, you might come
back without the sugar, because organized effort and money are necessary to
produce sugar, to say nothing of what is required to refine, transport, and deliver
it to the breakfast table anywhere in the United States.
The eggs, you could deliver easily enough from the barn yards near New
York City, but you would have a very long walk to Florida and return, before
you could serve the two glasses of grapefruit juice.
You would have another long walk, to Kansas, or one of the other wheat
growing states, when you went after the four slices of wheat bread.
The Rippled Wheat Biscuits would have to be omitted from the menu,
because they would not be available except through the labor of a trained
organization of men and suitable machinery, ALL OF WHICH CALL FOR
CAPITAL.
While resting, you could take off for another little swim down to South
America, where you would pick up a couple of bananas, and on your return, you
could take a short walk to the nearest farm having a dairy and pick up some
butter and cream. Then your New York City family would be ready to sit down
and enjoy breakfast, and you could collect your two dimes for your labor!
Seems absurd, doesn't it? Well, the procedure described would be the only
possible way these simple items of food could be delivered to the heart of New
York City, if we had no capitalistic system.
The sum of money required for the building and maintenance of the
railroads and steam ships used in the delivery of that simple breakfast is so huge
that it staggers one's imagination. It runs into hundreds of millions of dollars, not
to mention the armies of trained employees required to man the ships and trains.
But, transportation is only a part of the requirements of modern civilization in
capitalistic America. Before there can be anything to haul, something must be
grown from the ground, or manufactured and prepared for market. This calls for
more millions of dollars for equipment, machinery, boxing, marketing, and for
the wages of millions of men and women.
Steam ships and railroads do not spring up from the earth and function
automatically. They come in response to the call of civilization, through the labor
and ingenuity and organizing ability of men who have IMAGINATION, FAITH,

ENTHUSIASM, DECISION, PERSISTENCE! These men are known as capitalists.
They are motivated by the desire to build, construct, achieve, render useful
service, earn profits and accumulate riches. And, because they RENDER
SERVICE WITHOUT WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO CIVILIZATION, they put
themselves in the way of great riches.
Just to keep the record simple and understandable, I will add that these
capitalists are the self-same men of whom most of us have heard soap-box
orators speak. They are the same men to whom radicals, racketeers, dishonest
politicians and grafting labor leaders refer as "the predatory interests," or "Wall
Street."
I am not attempting to present a brief for or against any group of men or
any system of economics. I am not attempting to condemn collective bargaining
when I refer to "grafting labor leaders," nor do I aim to give a clean bill of health
to all individuals known as capitalists.
The purpose of this book—A purpose to which I have faithfully devoted over a
quarter of a century— is to present to all who want the knowledge, the most
dependable philosophy through which individuals may accumulate riches in
whatever amounts they desire.
I have here analyzed the economic advantages of the capitalistic system
for the two-fold purpose of showing:
1. that all who seek riches must recognize and adapt themselves to the
system that controls all approaches to fortunes, large or small, and
2. to present the side of the picture opposite to that being shown by
politicians and demagogues who deliberately becloud the issues they bring up,
by referring to organized capital as if it were something poisonous.
This is a capitalistic country, it was developed through the use of capital,
and we who claim the right to partake of the blessings of freedom and
opportunity, we who seek to accumulate riches here, may as well know that
neither riches nor opportunity would be available to us if ORGANIZED
CAPITAL had not provided these benefits.
For more than twenty years it has been a somewhat popular and growing
pastime for radicals, self-seeking politicians, racketeers, crooked labor leaders,
and on occasion religious leaders, to take pot-shots at "WALL STREET, THE
MONEY CHANGERS, and BIG BUSINESS."


The practice became so general that we witnessed during the business
depression, the unbelievable sight of high government officials lining up with the
cheap politicians, and labor leaders, with the openly avowed purpose of
throttling the system which has made Industrial America the richest country on
earth. The line-up was so general and so well organized that it prolonged the
worst depression America has ever known. It cost millions of men their jobs,
because those jobs were inseparably a part of the industrial and capitalistic
system which form the very backbone of the nation.
During this unusual alliance of government officials and self-seeking
individuals who were endeavoring to profit by declaring "open season" on the
American system of industry, a certain type of labor leader joined forces with the
politicians and offered to deliver voters in return for legislation designed to
permit men to TAKE RICHES AWAY FROM INDUSTRY BY ORGANIZED
FORCE OF NUMBERS, INSTEAD OF THE BETTER METHOD OF GIVING A
FAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A FAIR DAY'S PAY.
Millions of men and women throughout the nation are still engaged in
this popular pastime of trying to GET without GIVING. Some of them are lined
up with labor unions, where they demand SHORTER HOURS AND MORE PAY!
Others do not take the trouble to work at all. THEY DEMAND GOVERNMENT
RELIEF AND ARE GETTING IT. Their idea of their rights of freedom was
demonstrated in New York City, where violent complaint was registered with
the Postmaster, by a group of "relief beneficiaries," because the Postmen
awakened them at 7: 30 A. M. to deliver Government relief checks. They
DEMANDED that the time of delivery be set up to 10: 00 o'clock.
If you are one of those who believe that riches can be accumulated by the
mere act of men who organize themselves into groups and demand MORE PAY
for LESS SERVICE, if you are one of those who DEMAND Government relief
without early morning disturbance when the money is delivered to you, if you
are one of those who believe in trading their votes to politicians in return for the
passing of laws which permit the raiding of the public treasury, you may rest
securely on your belief, with certain knowledge that no one will disturb you,
because THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY WHERE EVERY MAN MAY THINK AS HE
PLEASES, where nearly everybody can live with but little effort, where many
may live well without doing any work whatsoever.
However, you should know the full truth concerning this FREEDOM of
which so many people boast, and so few understand. As great as it is, as far as it


reaches, as many privileges as it provides, IT DOES NOT, AND CANNOT
BRING RICHES WITHOUT EFFORT.
There is but one dependable method of accumulating, and legally holding
riches, and that is by rendering useful service. No system has ever been created
by which men can legally acquire riches through mere force of numbers, or
without giving in return an equivalent value of one form or another.
There is a principle known as the law of ECONOMICS! This is more than
a theory. It is a law no man can beat.
Mark well the name of the principle, and remember it, because it is far
more powerful than all the politicians and political machines. It is above and
beyond the control of all the labor unions. It cannot be swayed, nor influenced
nor bribed by racketeers or self-appointed leaders in any calling. Moreover, IT
HAS AN ALL-SEEING EYE, AND A PERFECT SYSTEM OF BOOKKEEPING, in
which it keeps an accurate account of the transactions of every human being
engaged in the business of trying to get without giving. Sooner or later its
auditors come around, look over the records of individuals both great and small,
and demand an accounting.
"Wall Street, Big Business, Capital Predatory Interests," or whatever name
you choose to give the system which has given us AMERICAN FREEDOM,
represents a group of men who understand, respect, and adapt themselves to this
powerful LAW OF ECONOMICS! Their financial continuation depends upon
their respecting the law.
Most people living in America like this country, its capitalistic system and
all. I must confess I know of no better country, where one may find greater
opportunities to accumulate riches. Judging by their acts and deeds, there are
some in this country who do not like it. That, of course is their privilege; if they
do not like this country, its capitalistic system, its boundless opportunities, THEY
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CLEARING OUT! Always there are other countries,
such as Germany, Russia, and Italy, where one may try one's hand at enjoying
freedom, and accumulating riches providing one is not too particular.
America provides all the freedom and all the opportunity to accumulate
riches that any honest person may require. When one goes hunting for game, one
selects hunting grounds where game is plentiful. When seeking riches, the same
rule would naturally obtain.
If it is riches you are seeking, do not overlook the possibilities of a country
whose citizens are so rich that women, alone, spend over two hundred million
dollars annually for lip-sticks, rouge and cosmetics. Think twice, you who are

seeking riches, before trying to destroy the Capitalistic System of a country
whose citizens spend over fifty million dollars a year for GREETING CARDS,
with which to express their appreciation of their FREEDOM!
If it is money you are seeking, consider carefully a country that spends
hundreds of millions of dollars annually for cigarettes, the bulk of the income
from which goes to only four major companies engaged in supplying this
national builder of "non-chalance" and "quiet nerves."
By all means give plenty of consideration to a country whose people
spend annually more than fifteen million dollars for the privilege of seeing
moving pictures, and toss in a few additional mil-lions for liquor, narcotics, and
other less potent soft drinks and giggle-waters.
Do not be in too big a hurry to get away from a country whose people
willingly, even eagerly, hand over millions of dollars annually for football,
baseball, and prize fights.
And, by all means, STICK by a country whose inhabitants give up more
than a million dollars a year for chewing gum, and another million for safety
razor blades.
Remember, also, that this is but the beginning of the available sources for
the accumulation of wealth. Only a few of the luxuries and non-essentials have
been mentioned. But, remember that the business of producing, transporting,
and marketing these few items of merchandise gives regular employment to
MANY MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN, who receive for their services
MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MONTHLY, and spend it freely for both the
luxuries and the necessities.
Especially remember, that back of all this exchange of merchandise and
personal services may be found an abundance of OPPORTUNITY to accumulate
riches. Here our AMERICAN FREE-DOM comes to one's aid. There is nothing to
stop you, or anyone from engaging in any portion of the effort necessary to carry
on these businesses. If one has superior talent, training, experience, one may
accumulate riches in large amounts. Those not so fortunate may accumulate
smaller amounts. Anyone may earn a living in return for a very nominal amount
of labor.
So— there you are!
OPPORTUNITY has spread its wares before you. Step up to the front,
select what you want, create your plan, put the plan into action, and follow
through with PERSISTENCE. "Capitalistic" America will do the rest. You can
depend upon this much— CAPITALISTIC AMERICA INSURES EVERY

PERSON THE OPPORTUNITY TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE, AND TO
COLLECT RICHES IN PROPORTION TO THE VALUE OF THE SERVICE.
The "System" denies no one this right, but it does not, and cannot promise
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING, because the system, itself, is irrevocably
controlled by the LAW OF ECONOMICS which neither recognizes nor tolerates
for long, GETTING WITHOUT GIVING.
The LAW OF ECONOMICS was passed by Nature! There is no Supreme
Court to which violators of this law may appeal. The law hands out both
penalties for its violation, and appropriate rewards for its observance, without
interference or the possibility of interference by any human being. The law
cannot be repealed. It is as fixed as the stars in the heavens, and subject to, and a
part of the same system that controls the stars.
May one refuse to adapt one's self to the LAW OF ECONOMICS?
Certainly! This is a free country, where all men are born with equal rights,
including the privilege of ignoring the LAW OF ECONOMICS.
What happens then?
Well, nothing happens until large numbers of men join forces for the
avowed purpose of ignoring the law, and taking what they want by force.
THEN COMES THE DICTATOR, WITH WELL ORGANIZED FIRING
SQUADS AND MACHINE GUNS!
We have not yet reached that stage in America! But we have heard all we
want to know about how the system works. Perhaps we hal1 be fortunate
enough not to demand personal knowledge of so gruesome a reality. Doubtless
we shall prefer to continue with our FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF
DEED, and FREEDOM TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE IN RETURN FOR
RICHES.
The practice, by Government officials of extending to men and women the
privilege of raiding the public treasury in return for votes, sometimes results in
election, but as night follows day, the final payoff comes; when every penny
wrongfully used, must be repaid with compound interest on compound interest.
If those who make the grab are not forced to repay, the burden falls on their
children, and their children's children, "even unto the third and fourth
generations." There is no way to avoid the debt.
Men can, and sometimes do, form themselves into groups for the purpose
of crowding wages up, and working hours down. There is a point beyond which
they cannot go. It is the point at which the LAW OF ECONOMICS steps in, and
the sheriff gets both the employer and the employees.

For six years, from 1929, to 1935, the people of America, both rich and
poor, barely missed seeing the Old Man Economics hand over to the sheriff all
the businesses, and industries and banks. It was not a pretty sight! It did not
increase our respect for mob psychology through which men cast reason to the
winds and start trying to GET without GIVING.
We who went through those six discouraging years, when FEAR WAS IN
THE SADDLE, AND FAITH WAS ON THE GROUND, cannot forget how
ruthlessly the LAW OF ECONOMICS exacted its toll from both rich and poor,
weak and strong, old and young. We shall not wish to go through another such
experience.
These observations are not founded upon short-time experience. They are
the result of twenty-five years of careful analysis of the methods of both the most
successful and the most unsuccessful men America has known.


CHAPTER 8
DECISION
THE MASTERY OF PROCRASTINATION
The Seventh Step toward Riches
ACCURATE analysis of over 25,000 men and women who had
experienced failure, disclosed the fact that LACK OF DECISION was near the
head of the list of the 30 major causes of FAILURE. This is no mere statement of a
theory— it is a fact.
PROCRASTINATION, the opposite of DECISION, is a common enemy
which practically every man must conquer.
You will have an opportunity to test your capacity to reach quick and
definite DECISIONS when you finish reading this book, and are ready to begin
putting into ACTION the principles which it describes.
Analysis of several hundred people who had accumulated fortunes well
beyond the million dollar mark, disclosed the fact that every one of them had the
habit of REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY, and of changing these decisions
SLOWLY, if, and when they were changed. People who fail to accumulate
money, without exception, have the habit of reaching decisions, IF AT ALL, very
slowly, and of changing these decisions quickly and often.
One of Henry Ford's most outstanding qualities is his habit of reaching
decisions quickly and definitely, and changing them slowly. This quality is so
pronounced in Mr. Ford, that it has given him the reputation of being obstinate.
It was this quality which prompted Mr. Ford to continue to manufacture his
famous Model "T" (the world's ugliest car), when all of his advisors, and many of
the purchasers of the car, were urging him to change it.
Perhaps, Mr. Ford delayed too long in making the change, but the other
side of the story is, that Mr. Ford's firmness of decision yielded a huge fortune,
before the change in model became necessary. There is but little doubt that Mr.
Ford's habit of definiteness of decision assumes the proportion of obstinacy, but
this quality is preferable to slowness in reaching decisions and quickness in
changing them.

The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their
needs, are, generally, easily influenced by the "opinions" of others. They permit
the newspapers and the "gossiping" neighbors to do their "thinking" for them.
"Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of
opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are
influenced by "opinions" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in
any undertaking, much less in that of transmuting YOUR OWN DESIRE into
money.
If you are influenced by the opinions of others, you will have no DESIRE
of your own.
Keep your own counsel, when you begin to put into practice the
principles described here, by reaching your own decisions and following them.
Take no one into your confidence, EXCEPT the members of your "Master Mind"
group, and be very sure in your selection of this group, that you choose ONLY
those who will be in COMPLETE SYMPATHY AND HARMONY WITH YOUR
PURPOSE.
Close friends and relatives, while not meaning to do so, often handicap
one through "opinions" and sometimes through ridicule, which is meant to be
humorous. Thousands of men and women carry inferiority complexes with them
all through life, because some well-meaning, but ignorant person destroyed their
confidence through "opinions" or ridicule.
You have a brain and mind of your own. USE IT, and reach your own
decisions. If you need facts or information from other people, to enable you to
reach decisions, as you probably will in many instances; acquire these facts or
secure the information you need quietly, without disclosing your purpose.
It is characteristic of people who have but a smattering or a veneer of
knowledge to try to give the impression that they have much knowledge. Such
people generally do TOO MUCH talking, and TOO LITTLE listening. Keep your
eyes and ears wide open— and your mouth CLOSED, if you wish to acquire the
habit of prompt DECISION. Those who talk too much do little else. If you talk
more than you listen, you not only deprive yourself of many opportunities to
accumulate useful knowledge, but you also disclose your PLANS and
PURPOSES to people who will take great delight in defeating you, because they
envy you.
Remember, also, that every time you open your mouth in the presence of a
person who has an abundance of knowledge, you display to that person, your


exact stock of knowledge, or your LACK of it! Genuine wisdom is usually
conspicuous through modesty and silence.
Keep in mind the fact that every person with whom you associate is, like
yourself, seeking the opportunity to accumulate money. If you talk about your
plans too freely, you may be surprised when you learn that some other person
has beaten you to your goal by PUTTING INTO ACTION AHEAD OF YOU, the
plans of which you talked unwisely.
Let one of your first decisions be to KEEP A CLOSED MOUTH AND
OPEN EARS AND EYES.
As a reminder to yourself to follow this advice, it will be helpful if you
copy the following epigram in large letters and place it where you will see it
daily.
"TELL THE WORLD WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO, BUT FIRST SHOW
IT."
This is the equivalent of saying that "deeds, and not words, are what count
most."
FREEDOM OR DEATH ON A DECISION
The value of decisions depends upon the courage required to render them.
The great decisions, which served as the foundation of civilization, were reached
by assuming great risks, which often meant the possibility of death.
Lincoln's decision to issue his famous Proclamation of Emancipation,
which gave freedom to the colored people of America, was rendered with full
understanding that his act would turn thousands of friends and political
supporters against him. He knew, too, that the carrying out of that proclamation
would mean death to thousands of men on the battlefield. In the end, it cost
Lincoln his life. That required courage.
Socrates' decision to drink the cup of poison, rather than compromise in
his personal belief, was a decision of courage. It turned Time ahead a thousand
years, and gave to people then unborn, the right to freedom of thought and of
speech.
The decision of Gen. Robert E. Lee, when he came to the parting of the
way with the Union, and took up the cause of the South, was a decision of
courage, for he well knew that it might cost him his own life, that it would surely
cost the lives of others.
But, the greatest decision of all time, as far as any American citizen is
concerned, was reached in Philadelphia, July 4, 1776, when fifty-six men signed

their names to a document, which they well knew would bring freedom to all
Americans, or leave every one of the fifty-six hanging from a gallows!
You have heard of this famous document, but you may not have drawn
from it the great lesson in personal achievement it so plainly taught.
We all remember the date of this momentous decision, but few of us
realize what courage that decision required. We remember our history, as it was
taught; we remember dates, and the names of the men who fought; we remember
Valley Forge, and Yorktown; we remember George Washington, and Lord
Cornwallis. But we know little of the real forces back of these names, dates, and
places. We know still less of that intangible POWER, which insured us freedom
long before Washington's armies reached Yorktown.
We read the history of the Revolution, and falsely imagine that George
Washington was the Father of our Country, that it was he who won our freedom,
while the truth is—Washington was only an accessory after the fact, because
victory for his armies had been insured long before Lord Cornwallis
surrendered. This is not intended to rob Washington of any of the glory he so
richly merited. Its purpose, rather, is to give greater attention to the astounding
POWER that was the real cause of his victory.
It is nothing short of tragedy that the writers of history have missed,
entirely, even the slightest reference to the irresistible POWER, which gave birth
and freedom to the nation destined to set up new standards of independence for
all the peoples of the earth. I say it is a tragedy, because it is the self-same
POWER which must be used by every individual who surmounts the difficulties
of Life, and forces Life to pay the price asked.
Let us briefly review the events which gave birth to this POWER. The
story begins with an incident in Boston, March 5, 1770. British soldiers were
patroling the streets, by their presence, openly threatening the citizens. The
colonists resented armed men marching in their midst. They began to express
their resentment openly, hurling stones as well as epithets, at the marching
soldiers, until the commanding officer gave orders, "Fix bayonets. . . . Charge!"
The battle was on. It resulted in the death and injury of many. The
incident aroused such resentment that the Provincial Assembly, (made up of
prominent colonists), called a meeting for the purpose of taking definite action.
Two of the members of that Assembly were, John Hancock, and Samuel Adams
—LONG LIVE THEIR NAMES! They spoke up courageously, and declared that a
move must be made to eject all British soldiers from Boston.


Remember this—a DECISION, in the minds of two men, might properly
be called the beginning of the freedom which we, of the United States now enjoy.
Remember, too, that the DECISION of these two men called for FAITH, and
COURAGE, because it was dangerous.
Before the Assembly adjourned, Samuel Adams was appointed to call on
the Governor of the Province, Hutchinson, and demand the withdrawal of the
British troops.
The request was granted, the troops were removed from Boston, but the
incident was not closed. It had caused a situation destined to change the entire
trend of civilization. Strange, is it not, how the great changes, such as the
American Revolution, and the World War, often have their beginnings in
circumstances which seem unimportant? It is interesting, also, to observe that
these important changes usually begin in the form of a DEFINITE DECISION in
the minds of a relatively small number of people. Few of us know the history of
our country well enough to realize that John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and
Richard Henry Lee (of the Province of Virginia) were the real Fathers of our
Country.
Richard Henry Lee became an important factor in this story by reason of
the fact that he and Samuel Adams communicated frequently (by
correspondence), sharing freely their fears and their hopes concerning the
welfare of the people of their Provinces. From this practice, Adams conceived the
idea that a mutual exchange of letters between the thirteen Colonies might help
to bring about the coordination of effort so badly needed in connection with the
solution of their problems. Two years after the clash with the soldiers in Boston
(March '72), Adams presented this idea to the Assembly, in the form of a motion
that a Correspondence Committee be established among the Colonies, with
definitely appointed correspondents in each Colony, "for the purpose of friendly
cooperation for the betterment of the Colonies of British America."
Mark well this incident! It was the beginning of the organization of the
far-flung POWER destined to give freedom to you, and to me. The Master Mind
had already been organized. It consisted of Adams, Lee, and Hancock. "I tell you
further, that if two of you agree upon the earth concerning anything for which
you ask, it will come to you from My Father, who is in Heaven."
The Committee of Correspondence was organized. Observe that this move
provided the way for increasing the power of the Master Mind by adding to it
men from all the Colonies. Take notice that this procedure constituted the first
ORGANIZED PLANNING of the disgruntled Colonists.

In union there is strength! The citizens of the Colonies had been waging
disorganized warfare against the British soldiers, through incidents similar to the
Boston riot, but nothing of benefit had been accomplished. Their individual
grievances had not been consolidated under one Master Mind. No group of
individuals had put their hearts, minds, souls, and bodies together in one
definite DECISION to settle their difficulty with the British once and for all, until
Adams, Hancock, and Lee got together.
Meanwhile, the British were not idle. They, too, were doing some
PLANNING and "Master-Minding" on their own account, with the advantage of
having back of them money, and organized soldiery.
The Crown appointed Gage to supplant Hutchinson as the Governor of
Massachusetts. One of the new Governor's first acts was to send a messenger to
call on Samuel Adams, for the purpose of endeavoring to stop his opposition—
by FEAR.
We can best understand the spirit of what happened by quoting the
conversation between Col. Fenton, (the messenger sent by Gage), and Adams.
Col. Fenton: "I have been authorized by Governor Gage, to assure you,
Mr. Adams, that the Governor has been empowered to confer upon you such
benefits as would be satisfactory, [endeavor to win Adams by promise of bribes],
upon the condition that you engage to cease in your opposition to the measures
of the government. It is the Governor's advice to you, Sir, not to incur the further
displeasure of his majesty. Your conduct has been such as makes you liable to
penalties of an Mt of Henry VIII, by which persons can be sent to England for
trial for treason, or misprision of treason, at the discretion of a governor of a
province. But, BY CHANGING YOUR POLITICAL COURSE, you will not only
receive great personal advantages, but you will make your peace with the King."
Samuel Adams had the choice of two DECISIONS. He could cease his
opposition, and receive personal bribes, or he could CONTINUE, AND RUN
THE RISK OF BEING HANGED!
Clearly, the time had come when Adams was forced to reach instantly, a
DECISION which could have cost his life. The majority of men would have
found it difficult to reach such a decision. The majority would have sent back an
evasive reply, but not Adams! He insisted upon Col. Fenton's word of honor, that
the Colonel would deliver to the Governor the answer exactly as Adams would
give it to him.
Adams' answer, "Then you may tell Governor Gage that I trust I have long
since made my peace with the King of Kings. No personal consideration shall

induce me to abandon the righteous cause of my Country. And, TELL
GOVERNOR GAGE IT IS THE ADVICE OF SAMUEL ADAMS TO HIM, no
longer to insult the feelings of an exasperated people."
Comment as to the character of this man seems unnecessary. It must be
obvious to all who read this astounding message that its sender possessed
loyalty of the highest order. This is important. (Racketeers and dishonest
politicians have prostituted the honor for which such men as Adams died).
When Governor Gage received Adams' caustic reply, he flew into a rage,
and issued a proclamation which read, "I do, hereby, in his majesty's name, offer
and promise his most gracious pardon to all persons who shall forthwith lay
down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects, excepting only
from the benefit of such pardon, SAMUEL ADAMS AND JOHN HANCOCK,
whose offences are of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other consideration
but that of condign punishment."
As one might say, in modern slang, Adams and Hancock were "on the
spot!" The threat of the irate Governor forced the two men to reach another
DECISION, equally as dangerous. They hurriedly called a secret meeting of their
staunchest followers. (Here the Master Mind began to take on momentum). After
the meeting had been called to order, Adams locked the door, placed the key in
his pocket, and informed all present that it was imperative that a Congress of the
Colonists be organized, and that NO MAN SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM
UNTIL THE DECISION FOR SUCH A CONGRESS HAD BEEN REACHED.
Great excitement followed. Some weighed the possible consequences of
such radicalism. (Old Man Fear). Some expressed grave doubt as to the wisdom
of so definite a decision in defiance of the Crown. Locked in that room were TWO
MEN immune to Fear, blind to the possibility of Failure. Hancock and Adams.
Through the influence of their minds, the others were induced to agree that,
through the Correspondence Committee, arrangements should be made for a
meeting of the First Continental Congress, to be held in Philadelphia, September
5, 1774.
Remember this date. It is more important than July 4, 1776. If there had
been no DECISION to hold a Continental Congress, there could have been no
signing of the Declaration of Independence.
Before the first meeting of the new Congress, another leader, in a different
section of the country was deep in the throes of publishing a "Summary View of
the Rights of British America." He was Thomas Jefferson, of the Province of


Virginia, whose relationship to Lord Dunmore, (representative of the Crown in
Virginia), was as strained as that of Hancock and Adams with their Governor.
Shortly after his famous Summary of Rights was published, Jefferson was
informed that he was subject to prosecution for high treason against his majesty's
government. Inspired by the threat, one of Jefferson's colleagues, Patrick Henry,
boldly spoke his mind, concluding his remarks with a sentence which shall
remain forever a classic, "If this be treason, then make the most of it."
It was such men as these who, without power, without authority, without
military strength, without money, sat in solemn consideration of the destiny of
the colonies, beginning at the opening of the First Continental Congress, and
continuing at intervals for two years— until on June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee
arose, addressed the Chair, and to the startled Assembly made this motion:
"Gentlemen, I make the motion that these United Colonies are, and of
right ought to be free and independent states, that they be absolved from all
allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them
and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be totally dissolved."
Lee's astounding motion was discussed fervently, and at such length that
he began to lose patience. Finally, after days of argument, he again took the floor,
and declared, in a clear, firm voice, "Mr. President, we have discussed this issue
for days. It is the only course for us to follow. Why, then Sir, do we longer delay?
Why still deliberate? Let this happy day give birth to an American Republic. Let
her arise, not to devastate and to conquer, but to re-establish the reign of peace,
and of law. The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us. She demands of us a living
example of freedom, that may exhibit a contrast, in the felicity of the citizen, to
the ever increasing tyranny."
Before his motion was finally voted upon, Lee was called back to Virginia,
because of serious family illness, but before leaving, he placed his cause in the
hands of his friend, Thomas Jefferson, who promised to fight until favorable
action was taken. Shortly thereafter the President of the Congress (Hancock),
appointed Jefferson as Chairman of a Committee to draw up a Declaration of
Independence.
Long and hard the Committee labored, on a document which would
mean, when accepted by the Congress, that EVERY MAN WHO SIGNED IT,
WOULD BE SIGNING HIS OWN DEATH WARRANT, should the Colonies lose
in the fight with Great Britain, which was sure to follow.
The document was drawn, and on June 28, the original draft was read
before the Congress. For several days it was discussed, altered, and made ready.

On July 4, 1776, Thomas Jefferson stood before the Assembly, and fearlessly read
the most momentus DECISION ever placed upon paper.
"When in the course of human events it is necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to
assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which
the laws of Nature, and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the
opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
them to the separation. . . "
When Jefferson finished, the document was voted upon, accepted, and
signed by the fifty-six men, every one staking his own life upon his DECISION to
write his name. By that DECISION came into existence a nation destined to bring
to mankind forever, the privilege of making DECISIONS.
By decisions made in a similar spirit of Faith, and only by such decisions,
can men solve their personal problems, and win for themselves high estates of
material and spiritual wealth. Let us not forget this!
Analyze the events which led to the Declaration of Independence, and be
convinced that this nation, which now holds a position of commanding respect
and power among all nations of the world, was born of a DECISION created by a
Master Mind, consisting of fifty-six men. Note well, the fact that it was their
DECISION which insured the success of Washington's armies, because the spirit
of that decision was in the heart of every soldier who fought with him, and
served as a spiritual power which recognizes no such thing as FAILURE.
Note, also, (with great personal benefit), that the POWER which gave this
nation its freedom, is the self-same power that must be used by every individual
who becomes self-determining. This POWER is made up of the principles
described in this book. It will not be difficult to detect, in the story of the
Declaration of Independence, at least six of these principles; DESIRE, DECISION,
FAITH, PERSISTENCE, THE MASTER MIND, and ORGANIZED PLANNING.
Throughout this philosophy will be found the suggestion that thought,
backed by strong DESIRE, has a tendency to transmute itself into its physical
equivalent. Before passing on, I wish to leave with you the suggestion that one
may find in this story, and in the story of the organization of the United States
Steel Corporation, a perfect description of the method by which thought makes
this astounding transformation.
In your search for the secret of the method, do not loo for a miracle,
because you will not find it. You will find only the eternal laws of Nature. These
laws are available to every person who has the FAITH and the COURAGE to use

them. They may be used to bring freedom to a nation, or to accumulate riches.
There is no charge save the time necessary to understand and appropriate them.
Those who reach DECISIONS promptly and definitely, know what they
want, and generally get it. The leaders in every walk of life DECIDE quickly, and
firmly. That is the major reason why they are leaders. The world has the habit of
making room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where
he is going.
INDECISION is a habit which usually begins in youth. The habit takes on
permanency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, and even
through college, without DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. The major weakness of
all educational systems is that they neither teach nor encourage the habit of
DEFINITE DECISION.
It would be beneficial if no college would permit the enrollment of any
student, unless and until the student declared his major purpose in
matriculating. It would be of still greater benefit, if every student who enters the
graded schools were compelled to accept training in the HABIT OF DECISION,
and forced to pass a satisfactory examination on this subject before being
permitted to advance in the grades.
The habit of INDECISION acquired because of the deficiencies of our
school systems, goes with the student into the occupation he chooses . . . IF . . in
fact, he chooses his occupation. Generally, the youth just out of school seeks any
job that can be found. He takes the first place he finds, because he has fallen into
the habit of INDECISION. Ninety-eight out of every hundred people working for
wages today, are in the positions they hold, because they lacked the
DEFINITENESS OF DECISION to PLAN A DEFINITE POSITION, and the
knowledge of how to choose an employer.
DEFINITENESS OF DECISION always requires courage, sometimes very
great courage. The fifty-six men who signed the Declaration of Independence
staked their lives on the DECISION to affix their signatures to that document.
The person who reaches a DEFINITE DECISION to procure the particular job,
and make life pay the price he asks, does not stake his life on that decision; he
stakes his ECONOMIC FREEDOM. Financial independence, riches, desirable
business and professional positions are not within reach of the person who
neglects or refuses to EXPECT, PLAN, and DEMAND these things. The person
who desires riches in the same spirit that Samuel Adams desired freedom for the
Colonies, is sure to accumulate wealth.


In the chapter on Organized Planning, you will find complete instructions
for marketing every type of personal services. You will find also detailed
information on how to choose the employer you prefer, and the particular job
you desire. These instructions will be of no value to you UNLESS YOU
DEFINITELY DECIDE to organize them into a plan of action.


CHAPTER 9
PERSISTENCE
THE SUSTAINED EFFORT NECESSARY TO INDUCE FAITH
The Eighth Step toward Riches
PERSISTENCE is an essential factor in the procedure of transmuting
DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. The basis of persistence is the POWER OF
WILL.
Will-power and desire, when properly combined, make an irresistible
pair. Men who accumulate great fortunes are generally known as cold-blooded,
and sometimes ruthless. Often they are misunderstood. What they have is willpower, which they mix with persistence, and place back of their desires to insure
the attainment of their objectives.
Henry Ford has been generally misunderstood to be ruthless and coldblooded. This misconception grew out of Ford's habit of following through in all
of his plans with PERSISTENCE.
The majority of people are ready to throw their aims and purposes
overboard, and give up at the first sign of opposition or misfortune. A few carry
on DESPITE all opposition, until they attain their goal. These few are the Fords,
Carnegies, Rockefellers, and Edisons.
There may be no heroic connotation to the word "persistence," but the
quality is to the character of man what carbon is to steel.
The building of a fortune, generally, involves the application of the entire
thirteen factors of this philosophy. These principles must be understood, they
must be applied with PERSISTENCE by all who accumulate money.
If you are following this book with the intention of applying the
knowledge it conveys, your first test as to your PERSISTENCE will come when
you begin to follow the six steps described in the second chapter. Unless you are
one of the two out of every hundred who already have a DEFINITE GOAL at
which you are aiming, and a DEFINITE PLAN for its attainment, you may read
the instructions, and then pass on with your daily routine, and never comply
with those instructions.

The author is checking you up at this point, because lack of persistence is
one of the major causes of failure. Moreover, experience with thousands of
people has proved that lack of persistence is a weakness common to the majority
of men. It is a weakness which may be overcome by effort. The ease with which
lack of persistence may be conquered will depend entirely upon the INTENSITY
OF ONE'S DESIRE.
The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in
mind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of fire makes a
small amount of heat. If you find yourself lacking in persistence, this weakness
may be remedied by building a stronger fire under your desires.
Continue to read through to the end, then go back to Chapter two, and
start immediately to carry out the instructions given in connection with the six
steps. The eagerness with which you follow these instructions will indicate
clearly, how much, or how little you really DESIRE to accumulate money. If you
find that you are indifferent, you may be sure that you have not yet acquired the
"money consciousness" which you must possess, before you can be sure of
accumulating a fortune.
Fortunes gravitate to men whose minds have been prepared to "attract"
them, just as surely as water gravitates to the ocean. In this book may be found
all the stimuli necessary to "attune" any normal mind to the vibrations which will
attract the object of one's desires.
If you find you are weak in PERSISTENCE, center your attention upon the
instructions contained in the chapter on "Power"; surround yourself with a
"MASTER MIND" group, and through the cooperative efforts of the members of
this group, you can develop persistence. You will find additional instructions for
the development of persistence in the chapters on auto-suggestion, and the
subconscious mind. Follow the instructions outlined in these chapters until your
habit nature hands over to your subconscious mind, a clear picture of the object
of your DESIRE. From that point on, you will not be handicapped by lack of
persistence.
Your subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and
while you are asleep.
Spasmodic, or occasional effort to apply the rules will be of no value to
you. To get RESULTS, you must apply all of the rules until their application
becomes a fixed habit with you. In no other way can you develop the necessary
"money consciousness."


POVERTY is attracted to the one whose mind is favorable to it, as money
is attracted to him whose mind has been deliberately prepared to attract it, and
through the same laws. POVERTY CONSCIOUSNESS WILL VOLUNTARILY
SEIZE THE MIND WHICH IS NOT OCCUPIED WITH THE MONEY
CONSCIOUSNESS. A poverty consciousness develops without conscious
application of habits favorable to it. The money consciousness must be created to
order, unless one is born with such a consciousness.
Catch the full significance of the statements in the preceding paragraph,
and you will understand the importance of PERSISTENCE in the accumulation
of a fortune. Without PERSISTENCE, you will be defeated, even before you start.
With PERSISTENCE you will win.
If you have ever experienced a nightmare, you will realize the value of
persistence. You are lying in bed, half awake, with a feeling that you are about to
smother. You are unable to turn over, or to move a muscle. You realize that you
MUST BEGIN to regain control over your muscles. Through persistent effort of
will-power, you finally manage to move the fingers of one hand. By continuing
to move your fingers, you extend your control to the muscles of one arm, until
you can lift it. Then you gain control of the other arm in the same manner. You
finally gain control over the muscles of one leg, and then extend it to the other
leg. THEN— WITH ONE SUPREME EFFORT OF WILL— you regain complete
control over your muscular system, and "snap" out of your nightmare. The trick
has been turned step by step.
You may find it necessary to "snap" out of your mental inertia, through a
similar procedure, moving slowly at first, then increasing your speed, until you
gain complete control over your will. Be PERSISTENT no matter how slowly you
may, at first, have to move. WITH PERSISTENCE WILL COME SUCCESS.
If you select your "Master Mind" group with care, you will have in it, at
least one person who will aid you in the development of PERSISTENCE. Some
men who have accumulated great fortunes, did so because of NECESSITY. They
developed the habit of PERSISTENCE, because they were so closely driven by
circumstances, that they had to become persistent.
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PERSISTENCE! It cannot be supplanted
by any other quality! Remember this, and it will hearten you, in the beginning,
when the going may seem difficult and slow.
Those who have cultivated the HABIT of persistence seem to enjoy
insurance against failure. No matter how many times they are defeated, they
finally arrive up toward the top of the ladder. Sometimes it appears that there is

a hidden Guide whose duty is to test men through all sorts of discouraging
experiences. Those who pick themselves up after defeat and keep on trying,
arrive; and the world cries, "Bravo! I knew you could do it!" The hidden Guide
lets no one enjoy great achievement without passing the PERSISTENCE TEST.
Those who can't take it, simply do not make the grade.
Those who can "take it" are bountifully rewarded for their PERSISTENCE.
They receive, as their compensation, whatever goal they are pursuing. That is not
all! They receive something infinitely more important than material
compensation— the knowledge that "EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE
SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE."
There are exceptions to this rule; a few people know from experience the
soundness of persistence. They are the ones who have not accepted defeat as
being anything more than temporary. They are the ones whose DESIRES are so
PERSISTENTLY APPLIED that defeat is finally changed into victory. We who
stand on the side-lines of Life see the overwhelmingly large number who go
down in defeat, never to rise again. We see the few who take the punishment of
defeat as an urge to greater effort. These, fortunately, never learn to accept Life's
reverse gear. But what we DO NOT SEE, what most of us never suspect of
existing, is the silent but irresistible POWER which comes to the rescue of those
who fight on in the face of discouragement. If we speak of this power at all we
call it PERSISTENCE, and let it go at that. One thing we all know, if one does not
possess PERSISTENCE, one does not achieve noteworthy success in any calling.
As these lines are being written, I look up from my work, and see before
me, less than a block away, the great mysterious "Broadway," the "Graveyard of
Dead Hopes," and the "Front Porch of Opportunity." From all over the world
people have come to Broadway, seeking fame, fortune, power, love, or whatever
it is that human beings call success. Once in a great while someone steps out
from the long procession of seekers, and the world hears that another person has
mastered Broadway. But Broadway is not easily nor quickly conquered. She
acknowledges talent, recognizes genius, pays off in money, only after one has
refused to QUIT.
Then we know he has discovered the secret of how to conquer Broadway.
The secret is always inseparably attached to one word, PERSISTENCE!
The secret is told in the struggle of Fannie Hurst, whose PERSISTENCE
conquered the Great White Way. She came to New York in 1915, to convert
writing into riches. The conversion did not come quickly, BUT IT CAME. For
four years Miss Hurst learned about "The Sidewalks of New York" from first

hand experience. She spent her days laboring, and her nights HOPING. When
hope grew dim, she did not say, "Alright Broadway, you win!" She said, "Very
well, Broadway, you may whip some, but not me. I'm going to force you to give
up."
One publisher (The Saturday Evening Post) sent her thirty six rejection
slips, before she "broke the ice and got a story across. The average writer, like the
"average" in other walks of life, would have given up the job when the first
rejection slip came. She pounded the pavements for four years to the tune of the
publisher's "NO," because she was determined to win.
Then came the "payoff." The spell had been broken, the unseen Guide had
tested Fannie Hurst, and she could take it. From that time on publishers made a
beaten path to her door. Money came so fast she hardly had time to count it.
Then the moving picture men discovered her, and money came not in small
change, but in floods. The moving picture rights to her latest novel, "Great
Laughter," brought $100,000.00, said to be the highest price ever paid for a story
before publication. Her royalties from the sale of the book probably will run
much more.
Briefly, you have a description of what PERSISTENCE is capable of
achieving. Fannie Hurst is no exception. Wherever men and women accumulate
great riches, you may be sure they first acquired PERSISTENCE. Broadway will
give any beggar a cup of coffee and a sandwich, but it demands PERSISTENCE
of those who go after the big stakes.
Kate Smith will say "amen" when she reads this. For years she sang,
without money, and without price, before any microphone she could reach.
Broadway said to her, "Come and get it, if you can take it." She did take it until
one happy day Broadway got tired and said, "Aw, what's the use? You don't
know when you're whipped, so name your price, and go to work in earnest."
Miss Smith named her price! It was plenty. Away up in figures so high that one
week's salary is far more than most people make in a whole year.
Verily it pays to be PERSISTENT!
And here is an encouraging statement which carries with it a suggestion
of great significance— THOUSANDS OF SINGERS WHO EXCEL KATE SMITH
ARE WALKING UP AND DOWN BROADWAY LOOKING FOR A "BREAK"—
WITHOUT SUCCESS. Countless others have come and gone, many of them sang
well enough, but they failed to make the grade because they lacked the courage
to keep on keeping on, until Broadway became tired of turning them away.


Persistence is a state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated. Like all states of
mind, persistence is based upon definite causes, among them these:—
a. DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants
is the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the
development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to
surmount many difficulties.
b. DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to
maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire.
c. SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one's ability to carry out a plan
encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Selfreliance can be developed through the principle described in the
chapter on auto-suggestion).
d. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even
though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage
persistence.
e. ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one's plans are
sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages
persistence; "guessing" instead of "knowing" destroys persistence.
f. CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and
harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence.
g. WILL-POWER. The habit of concentrating one's thoughts
upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite 164 164
Page 165 166 165 purpose, leads to persistence.
h. HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind
absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it
feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by
forced repetition of acts of courage. Everyone who has seen active
service in war knows this.


Before leaving the subject of PERSISTENCE, take inventory of yourself,
and determine in what particular, if any, you are lacking in this essential quality.
Measure yourself courageously, point by point, and see how many of the eight
factors of persistence you lack. The analysis may lead to discoveries that will give
you a new grip on yourself.
SYMPTOMS OF LACK OF PERSISTENCE
Here you will find the real enemies which stand between you and
noteworthy achievement. Here you will find not only the "symptoms" indicating
weakness of PERSISTENCE, but also the deeply seated subconscious causes of
this weakness. Study the list carefully, and face yourself squarely IF YOU
REALLY WISH TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND WHAT YOU ARE CAPABLE
OF DOING. These are the weaknesses which must be mastered by all who
accumulate riches.
1. Failure to recognize and to clearly define exactly what one
wants.
2. Procrastination, with or without cause. (Usually backed
up with a formidable array of alibis and excuses).
3. Lack of interest in acquiring specialized knowledge.
4. Indecision, the habit of "passing the buck" on all occasions,
instead of facing issues squarely. (Also backed by alibis).
5. The habit of relying upon alibis instead of creating definite
plans for the solution of problems.
6. Self-satisfaction. There is but little remedy for this
affliction, and no hope for those who suffer from it.
7. Indifference, usually reflected in one's readiness to
compromise on all occasions, rather than meet opposition and fight
it.
8. The habit of blaming others for one's mistakes, and
accepting unfavorable circumstances as being unavoidable.
9. WEAKNESS OF DESIRE, due to neglect in the choice of
MOTIVES that impel action.
10. Willingness, even eagerness, to quit at the first sign of
defeat. (Based upon one or more of the 6 basic fears).


11. Lack of ORGANIZED PLANS, placed in writing where
they may be analyzed.
12. The habit of neglecting to move on ideas, or to grasp
opportunity when it presents itself.
13. WISHING instead of WILLING.
14. The habit of compromising with POVERTY instead of
aiming at riches. General absence of ambition to be, to do, and to
own.
15. Searching for all the shortcuts to riches, trying to GET
without GIVING a fair equivalent, usually reflected in the habit of
gambling, endeavoring to drive "sharp" bargains.
16. FEAR OF CRITICISM, failure to create plans and to put
them into action, because of what other people will think, do, or
say. This enemy belongs at the head of the list, because it generally
exists in one's subconscious mind, where its presence is not
recognized. (See the Six Basic Fears in a later chapter).
Let us examine some of the symptoms of the Fear of Criticism. The
majority of people permit relatives, friends, and the public at large to so
influence them that they cannot live their own lives, because they fear criticism.
Huge numbers of people make mistakes in marriage, stand by the bargain,
and go through life miserable and unhappy, because they fear criticism which
may follow if they correct the mistake. (Anyone who has submitted to this form
of fear knows the irreparable damage it does, by destroying ambition, selfreliance, and the desire to achieve).
Millions of people neglect to acquire belated educations, after having left
school, because they fear criticism.
Countless numbers of men and women, both young and old, permit
relatives to wreck their lives in the name of DUTY, because they fear criticism.
(Duty does not require any person to submit to the destruction of his personal
ambitions and the right to live his own life in his own way).
People refuse to take chances in business, because they fear the criticism
which may follow if they fail. The fear of criticism, in such cases is stronger than the
DESIRE for success.
Too many people refuse to set high goals for themselves, or even neglect
selecting a career, because they fear the criticism of relatives and "friends" who
may say "Don't aim so high, people will think you are crazy.

When Andrew Carnegie suggested that I devote twenty years to the
organization of a philosophy of individual achievement my first impulse of
thought was fear of what people might say. The suggestion set up a goal for me,
far out of proportion to any I had ever conceived. As quick as a flash, my mind
began to create alibis and excuses, all of them traceable to the inherent FEAR OF
CRITICISM. Something inside of me said, "You can't do it— the job is too big,
and requires too much time— what will your relatives think of you ?— how will
you earn a living?— no one has ever organized a philosophy of success, what
right have you to believe you can do it?— who are you, anyway, to aim so high?
— remember your humble birth— what do you know about philosophy—
people will think you are crazy—( and they did)— why hasn't some other person
done this before now?"
These, and many other questions flashed into my mind, and demanded
attention. It seemed as if the whole world had suddenly turned its attention to
me with the purpose of ridiculing me into giving up all desire to carry out Mr.
Carnegie's suggestion.
I had a fine opportunity, then and there, to kill off ambition before it
gained control of me. Later in life, after having analyzed thousands of people, I
discovered that MOST IDEAS ARE STILL-BORN, AND NEED THE BREATH OF
LIFE INJECTED INTO THEM THROUGH DEFINITE PLANS OF IMMEDIATE
ACTION. The time to nurse an idea is at the time of its birth. Every minute it
lives, gives it a better chance of surviving. The FEAR OF CRITICISM is at the
bottom of the destruction of most ideas which never reach the PLANNING and
ACTION stage.
Many people believe that material success is the result of favorable
"breaks." There is an element of ground for the belief, but those depending
entirely upon luck, are nearly always disappointed, because they overlook
another important factor which must be present before one can be sure of
success. It is the knowledge with which favorable "breaks" can be made to order.
During the depression, W. C. Fields, the comedian, lost all his money, and
found himself without income, without a job, and his means of earning a living
(vaudeville) no longer existed. Moreover, he was past sixty, when many men
consider themselves "old." He was so eager to stage a comeback that he offered to
work without pay, in a new field (movies). In addition to his other troubles, he
fell and injured his neck. To many that would have been the place to give up and
QUIT. But Fields was PERSISTENT. He knew that if he carried on he would get
the "breaks" sooner or later, and he did get them, but not by chance.

Marie Dressler found herself down and out, with her money gone, with
no job, when she was about sixty. She, too, went after the "breaks," and got them.
Her PERSISTENCE brought an astounding triumph late in life, long beyond the
age when most men and women are done with ambition to achieve.
Eddie Cantor lost his money in the 1929 stock crash, but he still had his
PERSISTENCE and his courage. With these, plus two prominent eyes, he
exploited himself back into an income of $10,000 a week! Verily, if one has
PERSISTENCE, one can get along very well without many other qualities.
The only "break" anyone can afford to rely upon is a self-made "break."
These come through the application of PERSISTENCE. The starting point is
DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE.
Examine the first hundred people you meet, ask them what they want
most in life, and ninety eight of them will not be able to tell you. If you press
them for an answer, some will say— SECURITY, many will say— MONEY, a few
will say— HAPPINESS, others will say— FAME AND POWER, and still others
will say— SOCIAL RECOGNITION, EASE IN LIVING, ABILITY TO SING,
DANCE, or WRITE, but none of them will be able to define these terms, or give
the slightest indication of a PLAN by which they hope to attain these vaguely
expressed wishes. Riches do not respond to wishes. They respond only to
definite plans, backed by definite desires, through constant PERSISTENCE.
HOW TO DEVELOP PERSISTENCE
There are four simple steps which lead to the habit of PERSISTENCE.
They call for no great amount of intelligence, no particular amount of education,
and but little time or effort. The necessary steps are:—
1. A DEFINITE PURPOSE BACKED BY BURNING DESIRE
FOR ITS FULFILLMENT.
2. A DEFINITE PLAN, EXPRESSED IN CONTINUOUS
ACTION.
3. A MIND CLOSED TIGHTLY AGAINST ALL NEGATIVE
AND DISCOURAGING INFLUENCES, including negative
suggestions of relatives, friends and acquaintances.
4. A FRIENDLY ALLIANCE WITH ONE OR MORE
PERSONS WHO WILL ENCOURAGE ONE TO FOLLOW
THROUGH WITH BOTH PLAN AND PURPOSE.

These four steps are essential for success in all walks of life. The entire
purpose of the thirteen principles of this philosophy is to enable one to take these
four steps as a matter of habit.
These are the steps by which one may control one's economic destiny.
They are the steps that lead to freedom and independence of thought.
They are the steps that lead to riches, in small or great quantities.
They lead the way to power, fame, and worldly recognition.
They are the four steps which guarantee favorable "breaks."
They are the steps that convert dreams into physical realities.
They lead, also, to the mastery of FEAR, DISCOURAGEMENT,
INDIFFERENCE.
There is a magnificent reward for all who learn to take these four steps. It
is the privilege of writing one's own ticket, and of making Life yield whatever
price is asked.
I have no way of knowing the facts, but I venture to conjecture that Mrs.
Wallis Simpson's great love for a man was not accidental, nor the result of
favorable "breaks" alone. There was a burning desire, and careful searching at
every step of the way. Her first duty was to love. What is the greatest thing on
earth? The Master called it love—not man made rules, criticism, bitterness,
slander, or political "marriages," but love.
She knew what she wanted, not after she met the Prince of Wales, but long
before that. Twice when she had failed to find it, she had the courage to continue
her search. "To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day,
thou canst not then be false to any man."
Her rise from obscurity was of the slow, progressive, PERSISTENT order,
but it was SURE! She triumphed over unbelievably long odds; and, no matter
who you are, or what you may think of Wallis Simpson, or the king who gave up
his Crown for her love, she is an astounding example of applied PERSISTENCE,
an instructor on the rules of self-determination, from whom the entire world
might profitably take lessons.
When you think of Wallis Simpson, think of one who knew what she
wanted, and shook the greatest empire on earth to get it. Women who complain
that this is a man's world, that women do not have an equal chance to win, owe it
to themselves to study carefully the life of this unusual woman, who, at an age

which most women consider "old," captured the affections of the most desirable
bachelor in the entire world.
And what of King Edward? What lesson may we learn from his part in the
world's greatest drama of recent times? Did he pay too high a price for the
affections of the woman of his choice?
Surely no one but he can give the correct answer. The rest of us can only
conjecture. This much we know, the king came into the world without his own
consent. He was born to great riches, without requesting them. He was
persistently sought in marriage; politicians and statesmen throughout Europe
tossed dowagers and princesses at his feet. Because he was the first born of his
parents, he inherited a crown, which he did not seek, and perhaps did not desire.
For more than forty years he was not a free agent, could not live his life in his
own way, had but little privacy, and finally assumed duties inflicted upon him
when he ascended the throne.
Some will say, "With all these blessings, King Edward should have found
peace of mind, contentment, and joy of living."
The truth is that back of all the privileges of a crown, all the money, the
fame, and the power inherited by King Edward, there was an emptiness which
could be filled only by love.
His greatest DESIRE was for love. Long before he met Wallis Simpson, he
doubtless felt this great universal emotion tugging at the strings of his heart,
beating upon the door of his soul, and crying out for expression.
And when he met a kindred spirit, crying out for this same Holy privilege
of expression, he recognized it, and without fear or apology, opened his heart
and bade it enter. All the scandal-mongers in the world cannot destroy the
beauty of this international drama, through which two people found love, and
had the courage to face open criticism, renounce ALL ELSE to give it holy
expression.
King Edward's DECISION to give up the crown of the world's most
powerful empire, for the privilege of going the remainder of the way through life
with the woman of his choice, was a decision that required courage. The decision
also had a price, but who has the right to say the price was too great? Surely not
He who said, "He among you who is without sin, let him cast the first stone."
As a suggestion to any evil-minded person who chooses to find fault with
the Duke of Windsor, because his DESIRE was for LOVE, and for openly
declaring his love for Wallis Simpson, and giving up his throne for her, let it be
remembered that the OPEN DECLARATION was not essential. He could have

followed the custom of clandestine liaison which has prevailed in Europe for
centuries, without giving up either his throne, or the woman of his choice, and
there would have been NO COMPLAINT FROM EITHER CHURCH OR LAITY.
ut this unusual man was built of sterner stuff. His love was clean. It was deep
and sincere. It represented the one thing which, above ALL ELSE he truly
DESIRED, therefore, he took what he wanted, and paid the price demanded.
If Europe had been blessed with more rulers with the human heart and
the traits of honesty of ex-king Edward, for the past century, that unfortunate
hemisphere now seething with greed, hate, lust, political connivance, and threats
of war, would have a DIFFERENT AND A BETTER STORY TO TELL. A story in
which Love and not Hate would rule.
In the words of Stuart Austin Wier we raise our cup and drink this toast to
ex-king Edward and Wallis Simpson:
"Blessed is the man who has come to know that our muted thoughts are
our sweetest thoughts.
"Blessed is the man who, from the blackest depths, can see the luminous
figure of LOVE, and seeing, sing; and singing, say: 'Sweeter far than uttered lays
are the thoughts I have of you. '"
In these words would we pay tribute to the two people who, more than all
others of modern times, have been the victims of criticism and the recipients of
abuse, because they found Life's greatest treasure, and claimed it. *Mrs. Simpson
read and approved this analysis.
Most of the world will applaud the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson,
because of their PERSISTENCE in searching until they found life's greatest
reward. ALL OF US CAN PROFIT by following their example in our own search
for that which we demand of life.
What mystical power gives to men of PERSISTENCE the capacity to
master difficulties? Does the quality of PERSISTENCE set up in one's mind some
form of spiritual, mental or chemical activity which gives one access to
supernatural forces? Does Infinite Intelligence throw itself on the side of the
person who still fights on, after the battle has been lost, with the whole world on
the opposing side?
These and many other similar questions have arisen in my mind as I have
observed men like Henry Ford, who started at scratch, and built an Industrial
Empire of huge proportions, with little else in the way of a beginning but

PERSISTENCE. Or, Thomas A. Edison, who, with less than three months of
schooling, became the world's leading inventor and converted PERSISTENCE
into the talking machine, the moving picture machine, and the incandescent
light, to say nothing of half a hundred other useful inventions.
I had the happy privilege of analyzing both Mr. Edison and Mr. Ford, year
by year, over a long period of years, and therefore, the opportunity to study
them at close range, so I speak from actual knowledge when I say that I found no
quality save PERSISTENCE, in either of them, that even remotely suggested the
major source of their stupendous achievements.
As one makes an impartial study of the prophets, philosophers, "miracle"
men, and religious leaders of the past, one is drawn to the inevitable conclusion
that PERSISTENCE, concentration of effort, and DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE,
were the major sources of their achievements.
Consider, for example, the strange and fascinating story of Mohammed;
analyze his life, compare him with men of achievement in this modern age of
industry and finance, and observe how they have one outstanding trait in
common, PERSISTENCE!
If you are keenly interested in studying the strange power which gives
potency to PERSISTENCE, read a biography of Mohammed, especially the one
by Essad Bey. This brief review of that book, by Thomas Sugrue, in the HeraldTribune, will provide a preview of the rare treat in store for those who take the
time to read the entire story of one of the most astounding examples of the power
of PERSISTENCE known to civilization.
THE LAST GREAT PROPHET
Reviewed by Thomas Sugrue
"Mohammed was a prophet, but he never performed a miracle. He was
not a mystic; he had no formal schooling; he did not begin his mission until he
was forty. When he announced that he was the Messenger of God, bringing word
of the true religion, he was ridiculed and labeled a lunatic. Children tripped him
and women threw filth upon him. He was banished from his native city, Mecca,
and his followers were stripped of their worldly goods and sent into the desert
after him. When he had been preaching ten years he had nothing to show for it
but banishment, poverty and ridicule. Yet before another ten years had passed,
he was dictator of all Arabia, ruler of Mecca, and the head of a New World

religion which was to sweep to the Danube and the Pyrenees before exhausting
the impetus he gave it. That impetus was three-fold: the power of words, the
efficacy of prayer and man's kinship with God.
"His career never made sense. Mohammed was born to impoverished
members of a leading family of Mecca. Because Mecca, the crossroads of the
world, home of the magic stone called the Caaba, great city of trade and the
center of trade routes, was unsanitary, its children were sent to be raised in the
desert by Bedouins. Mohammed was thus nurtured, drawing strength and health
from the milk of nomad, vicarious mothers. He tended sheep and soon hired out
to a rich widow as leader of her caravans. He traveled to all parts of the Eastern
World, talked with many men of diverse beliefs and observed the decline of
Christianity into warring sects. When he was twenty-eight, Khadija, the widow,
looked upon him with favor, and married him. Her father would have objected
to such a marriage, so she got him drunk and held him up while he gave the
paternal blessing. For the next twelve years Mohammed lived as a rich and
respected and very shrewd trader. Then he took to wandering in the desert, and
one day he returned with the first verse of the Koran and told Khadija that the
archangel Gabriel had appeared to him and said that he was to be the Messenger
of God.
"The Koran, the revealed word of God, was the closest thing to a miracle
in Mohammed's life. He had not been a poet; he had no gift of words. Yet the
verses of the Koran, as he received them and recited them to the faithful, were
better than any verses which the professional poets of the tribes could produce.
This, to the Arabs, was a miracle. To them the gift of words was the greatest gift,
the poet was all-powerful. In addition the Koran said that all men were equal
before God, that the world should be a democratic state— Islam. It was this
political heresy, plus Mohammed's desire to destroy all the 360 idols in the
courtyard of the Caaba, which brought about his banishment. The idols brought
the desert tribes to Mecca, and that meant trade. So the business men of Mecca,
the capitalists, of which he had been one, set upon Mohammed. Then he
retreated to the desert and demanded sovereignty over the world.
"The rise of Islam began. Out of the desert came a flame which would not
be extinguished— a democratic army fighting as a unit and prepared to die
without wincing. Mohammed had invited the Jews and Christians to join him;
for he was not building a new religion. He was calling all who believed in one
God to join in a single faith. If the Jews and Christians had accepted his invitation
Islam would have conquered the world. They didn't. They would not even

accept Mohammed's innovation of humane warfare. When the armies of the
prophet entered Jerusalem not a single person was killed because of his faith.
When the crusaders entered the city, centuries later, not a Moslem man, woman,
or child was spared. But the Christians did accept one Moslem idea— the place
of learning, the university."


CHAPTER 10
POWER OF THE MASTER MIND
THE DRIVING FORCE
The Ninth Step toward Riches
POWER is essential for success in the accumulation of money.
PLANS are inert and useless, without sufficient POWER to translate them
into ACTION. This chapter will describe the method by which an individual may
attain and apply POWER.
POWER may be defined as "organized and intelligently directed
KNOWLEDGE." Power, as the term is here used, refers to ORGANIZED effort,
sufficient to enable an individual to transmute DESIRE into its monetary
equivalent. ORGANIZED effort is produced through the coordination of effort of
two or more people, who work toward a DEFINITE end, in a spirit of harmony.
POWER IS REQUIRED FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF MONEY!
POWER IS NECESSARY FOR THE RETENTION OF MONEY AFTER IT HAS
BEEN ACCUMULATED!
Let us ascertain how power may be acquired. If power is "organized
knowledge," let us examine the sources of knowledge:
a. INFINITE INTELLIGENCE. This source of knowledge
may be contacted through the procedure described in another
chapter, with the aid of Creative Imagination.
b. ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE. The accumulated
experience of man, (or that portion of it which has been organized
and recorded), may be found in any well-equipped public library.
An important part of this accumulated experience is taught in
public schools and colleges, where it has been classified and
organized.
c. EXPERIMENT AND RESEARCH. In the field of science,
and in practically every other walk of life, men are gathering,
classifying, and organizing new facts daily. This is the source to

which one must turn when knowledge is not available through
"accumulated experience." Here, too, the Creative Imagination
must often be used.
Knowledge may be acquired from any of the foregoing sources. It may be
converted into POWER by organizing it into definite PLANS and by expressing
those plans in terms of ACTION.
Examination of the three major sources of knowledge will readily disclose
the difficulty an individual would have, if he depended upon his efforts alone, in
assembling knowledge and expressing it through definite plans in terms of
ACTION. If his plans are comprehensive, and if they contemplate large
proportions, he must, generally, induce others to cooperate with him, before he
can inject into them the necessary element of POWER.
GAINING POWER THROUGH THE '' MASTER MIND"
The "Master Mind" may be defined as: "Coordination of knowledge and
effort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of
a definite purpose."
No individual may have great power without availing himself of the
"Master Mind." In a preceding chapter, instructions were given for the creation of
PLANS for the purpose of translating DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. If
you carry out these instructions with PERSISTENCE and intelligence, and use
discrimination in the selection of your "Master Mind" group, your objective will
have been half-way reached, even before you begin to recognize it.
So you may better understand the "intangible" potentialities of power
available to you, through a properly chosen "Master Mind" group, we will here
explain the two characteristics of the Master Mind principle, one of which is
economic in nature, and the other psychic. The economic feature is obvious.
Economic advantages may be created by any person who surrounds himself with
the advice, counsel, and personal cooperation of a group of men who are willing
to lend him wholehearted aid, in a spirit of PERFECT HARMONY. This form of
cooperative alliance has been the basis of nearly every great fortune. Your
understanding of this great truth may definitely determine your financial status.
The psychic phase of the Master Mind principle is much more abstract,
much more difficult to comprehend, because it has reference to the spiritual
forces with which the human race, as a whole, is not well acquainted. You may

catch a significant suggestion from this statement: "No two minds ever come
together without, thereby, creating a third, invisible, intangible force which may
be likened to a third mind."
Keep in mind the fact that there are only two known elements in the
whole universe, energy and matter. It is a well known fact that matter may be
broken down into units of molecules, atoms, and electrons. There are units of
matter which may be isolated, separated, and analyzed.
Likewise, there are units of energy.
The human mind is a form of energy, a part of it being spiritual in nature.
When the minds of two people are coordinated in a SPIRIT OF HARMONY, the
spiritual units of energy of each mind form an affinity, which constitutes the
"psychic" phase of the Master Mind.
The Master Mind principle, or rather the economic feature of it, was first
called to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, over twenty-five years ago.
Discovery of this principle was responsible for the choice of my life's work.
Mr. Carnegie's Master Mind group consisted of a staff of approximately
fifty men, with whom he surrounded himself, for the DEFINITE PURPOSE of
manufacturing and marketing steel. He attributed his entire fortune to the
POWER he accumulated through this "Master Mind."
Analyze the record of any man who has accumulated a great fortune, and
many of those who have accumulated modest fortunes, and you will find that
they have either consciously, or unconsciously employed the "Master Mind"
principle.
GREAT POWER CAN BE ACCUMULATED THROUGH NO OTHER
PRINCIPLE!
ENERGY is Nature's universal set of building blocks, out of which she
constructs every material thing in the universe, including man, and every form of
animal and vegetable life. Through a process which only Nature completely
understands, she translates energy into matter.
Nature's building blocks are available to man, in the energy involved in
THINKING! Man's brain may be compared to an electric battery. It absorbs
energy from the ether, which permeates every atom of matter, and fills the entire
universe.
It is a well known fact that a group of electric batteries will provide more
energy than a single battery. It is also a well known fact that an individual
battery will provide energy in proportion to the number and capacity of the cells
it contains.

The brain functions in a similar fashion. This accounts for the fact that
some brains are more efficient than others, and leads to this significant statement
—a group of brains coordinated (or connected) in a spirit of harmony, will
provide more thought-energy than a single brain, just as a group of electric
batteries will provide more energy than a single battery.
Through this metaphor it becomes immediately obvious that the Master
Mind principle holds the secret of the POWER wielded by men who surround
themselves with other men of brains.
There follows, now, another statement which will lead still nearer to an
understanding of the psychic phase of the Master Mind principle: When a group
of individual brains are coordinated and function in Harmony, the increased
energy created through that alliance, becomes available to every individual brain
in the group.
It is a well known fact that Henry Ford began his business career under
the handicap of poverty, illiteracy, and ignorance. It is an equally well known
fact that, within the inconceivably short period of ten years, Mr. Ford mastered
these three handicaps, and that within twenty-five years he made himself one of
the richest men in America. Connect with this fact, the additional knowledge that
Mr. Ford's most rapid strides became noticeable, from the time he became a
personal friend of Thomas A. Edison, and you will begin to understand what the
influence of one mind upon another can accomplish. Go a step farther, and
consider the fact that Mr. Ford's most outstanding achievements began from the
time that he formed the acquaintances of Harvey Firestone, John Burroughs, and
Luther Burbank, (each a man of great brain capacity), and you will have further
evidence that POWER may be produced through friendly alliance of minds.
There is little if any doubt that Henry Ford is one of the best informed
men in the business and industrial world. The question of his wealth needs no
discussion. Analyze Mr. Ford's intimate personal friends, some of whom have
already been mentioned, and you will be prepared to understand the following
statement:— "Men take on the nature and the habits and the POWER OF
THOUGHT of those with whom they associate in a spirit of sympathy and
harmony."
Henry Ford whipped poverty, illiteracy, and ignorance by allying himself
with great minds, whose vibrations of thought he absorbed into his own mind.
Through his association with Edison, Burbank, Burroughs, and Firestone, Mr.
Ford added to his own brain power, the sum and substance of the intelligence,
experience, knowledge, and spiritual forces of these four men. Moreover, he

appropriated, and made use of the Master Mind principle through the methods
of procedure described in this book.
This principle is available to you!
We have already mentioned Mahatma Gandhi. Perhaps the majority of
those who have heard of Gandhi, look upon him as merely an eccentric little
man, who goes around without formal wearing apparel, and makes trouble for
the British Government. In reality, Gandhi is not eccentric, but HE IS THE MOST
POWERFUL MAN NOW LIVING. (Estimated by the number of his followers
and their faith in their leader.) Moreover, he is probably the most powerful man
who has ever lived.His power is passive, but it is real.
Let us study the method by which he attained his stupendous POWER. It
may be explained in a few words. He came by POWER through inducing over
two hundred million people to coordinate, with mind and body, in a spirit of
HARMONY, for a DEFINITE PURPOSE.
In brief, Gandhi has accomplished a MIRACLE, for it is a miracle when
two hundred million people can be induced— not forced— to cooperate in a
spirit of HARMONY, for a limitless time. If you doubt that this is a miracle, try to
induce ANY TWO PEOPLE to cooperate in a spirit of harmony for any length of
time.
Every man who manages a business knows what a difficult matter it is to
get employees to work together in a spirit even remotely resembling
HARMONY.
The list of the chief sources from which POWER may be attained is, as you
have seen, headed by INFINITE INTELLIGENCE. When two or more people
coordinate in a spirit of HARMONY, and work toward a definite objective, they
place themselves in position, through that alliance, to absorb power directly from
the great universal storehouse of Infinite Intelligence. This is the greatest of all
sources of POWER. It is the source to which the genius turns. It is the source to
which every great leader turns, (whether he may be conscious of the fact or not).
The other two major sources from which the knowledge, necessary for the
accumulation of POWER, may be obtained are no more reliable than the five
senses of man. The senses are not always reliable. Infinite Intelligence DOES
NOT ERR.
In subsequent chapters, the methods by which Infinite Intelligence may be
most readily contacted will be adequately described.
This is not a course on religion. No fundamental principle described in
this book should be interpreted as being intended to interfere either directly, or

indirectly, with any man's religious habits. This book has been confined,
exclusively, to instructing the reader how to transmute the DEFINITE PURPOSE
OF DESIRE FOR MONEY, into its monetary equivalent.
Read, THINK, and meditate as you read. Soon, the entire subject will
unfold, and you will see it in perspective. You are now seeing the detail of the
individual chapters.
Money is as shy and elusive as the "old time" maiden. It must be wooed
and won by methods not unlike those used by a determined lover, in pursuit of
the girl of his choice. And, coincidental as it is, the POWER used in the "wooing"
of money is not greatly different from that used in wooing a maiden. That power,
when successfully used in the pursuit of money must be mixed with FAITH. It
must be mixed with DESIRE. It must be mixed with PERSISTENCE. It must be
applied through a plan, and that plan must be set into ACTION.
When money comes in quantities known as "the big money," it flows to
the one who accumulates it, as easily as water flows down hill. There exists a
great unseen stream of POWER, which may be compared to a river; except that
one side flows in one direction, carrying all who get into that side of the stream,
onward and upward to WEALTH— and the other side flows in the opposite
direction, carrying all who are unfortunate enough to get into it (and not able to
extricate themselves from it), downward to misery and POVERTY.
Every man who has accumulated a great fortune, has recognized the
existence of this stream of life. It consists of one's THINKING PROCESS. The
positive emotions of thought form the side of the stream which carries one to
fortune. The negative emotions form the side which carries one down to poverty.
This carries a thought of stupendous importance to the person who is
following this book with the object of accumulating a fortune.
If you are in the side of the stream of POWER which leads to poverty, this
may serve as an oar, by which you may propel yourself over into the other side
of the stream. It can serve you ONLY through application and use. Merely
reading, and passing judgment on it, either one way or another, will in no way
benefit you.
Some people undergo the experience of alternating between the positive
and negative sides of the stream, being at times on the positive side, and at times
on the negative side. The Wall Street crash of '29 swept millions of people from
the positive to the negative side of the stream. These millions are struggling,
some of them in desperation and fear, to get back to the positive side of the
stream. This book was written especially for those millions.

Poverty and riches often change places. The Crash taught the world this
truth, although the world will not long remember the lesson. Poverty may, and
generally does, voluntarily take the place of riches. When riches take the place of
poverty, the change is usually brought about through well conceived and
carefully executed PLANS. Poverty needs no plan. It needs no one to aid it,
because it is bold and ruthless. Riches are shy and timid. They have to be
"attracted."
ANYBODY can WISH
for riches, and most
people do, but only a few
know that a definite plan,
plus a BURNING DESIRE
for wealth, are the only
dependable means of
accumulating wealth.


CHAPTER 11
THE MYSTERY OF SEX TRANSMUTATION
The Tenth Step toward Riches
The meaning of the word "transmute" is, in simple language, "the
changing, or transferring of one element, or form of energy, into another."
The emotion of sex brings into being a state of mind.
Because of ignorance on the subject, this state of mind is generally
associated with the physical, and because of improper influences, to which most
people have been subjected, in acquiring knowledge of sex, things essentially
physical have highly biased the mind.
The emotion of sex has back of it the possibility of three constructive
potentialities, they are:—
1. The perpetuation of mankind.
2. The maintenance of health, (as a therapeutic agency, it has no equal).
3. The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation.
Sex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching
of the mind from thoughts of physical expression, to thoughts of some other
nature.
Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this
desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence,
and creative ability unknown to them at other times. So strong and impelling is
the desire for sexual contact that men freely run the risk of life and reputation to
indulge it. When harnessed, and redirected along other lines, this motivating
force maintains all of its attributes of keenness of imagination, courage, etc.,
which may be used as powerful creative forces in literature, art, or in any other
profession or calling, including, of course, the accumulation of riches.
The transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of will-power, to be
sure, but the reward is worth the effort. The desire for sexual expression is inborn
and natural. The desire cannot, and should not be submerged or eliminated. But

it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body,
mind, and spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation,
it will seek outlets through purely physical channels.
A river may be dammed, and its water controlled for a time, but
eventually, it will force an outlet. The same is true of the emotion of sex. It may
be submerged and controlled for a time, but its very nature causes it to be ever
seeking means of expression. If it is not transmuted into some creative effort it
will find a less worthy outlet.
Fortunate, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex
emotion an outlet through some form of creative effort, for he has, by that
discovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius.
Scientific research has disclosed these significant facts:
1. The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex
natures; men who have learned the art of sex transmutation.
2. The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved
outstanding recognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the
professions, were motivated by the influence of a woman.
The research from which these astounding discoveries were made, went
back through the pages of biography and history for more than two thousand
years. Wherever there was evidence available in connection with the lives of men
and women of great achievement, it indicated most convincingly that they
possessed highly developed sex natures.
The emotion of sex is an "irresistible force," against which there can be no
such opposition as an "immovable body." When driven by this emotion, men
become gifted with a super power for action. Understand this truth, and you will
catch the significance of the statement that sex transmutation will lift one to the
status of a genius.
The emotion of sex contains the secret of creative ability.
Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed
the major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to any animal
after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it has been
altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all
the FIGHT that was in him. Sex alteration of the female has the same effect.
THE TEN MIND STIMULI

The human mind responds to stimuli, through which it may be "keyed up"
to high rates of vibration, known as enthusiasm, creative imagination, intense
desire, etc. The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:—
1. The desire for sex expression
2. Love
3. A burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain, MONEY
4. Music
5. Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the
opposite sex.
6. A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people
who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement.
7. Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are
persecuted.
8. Auto-suggestion
9. Fear
10. Narcotics and alcohol.
The desire for sex expression comes at the head of the list of stimuli, which
most effectively "stepup" the vibrations of the mind and start the "wheels" of
physical action. Eight of these stimuli are natural and constructive. Two are
destructive. The list is here presented for the purpose of enabling you to make a
comparative study of the major sources of mind stimulation. From this study, it
will be readily seen that the emotion of sex is, by great odds, the most intense
and powerful of all mind stimuli.
This comparison is necessary as a foundation for proof of the statement
that transmutation of sex energy may lift one to the status of a genius. Let us find
out what constitutes a genius.
Some wiseacre has said that a genius is a man who "wears long hair, eats
queer food, lives alone, and serves as a target for the joke makers." A better
definition of a genius is, "a man who has discovered how to increase the
vibrations of thought to the point where he can freely communicate with sources
of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought."
The person who thinks will want to ask some questions concerning this
definition of genius. The first question will be, "How may one communicate with


sources of knowledge which are not available through the ORDINARY rate of
vibration of thought?"
The next question will be, "Are there known sources of knowledge which
are available only to genii, and if so, WHAT ARE THESE SOURCES, and exactly
how may they be reached?"
We shall offer proof of the soundness of some of the more important
statements made in this book— or at least we shall offer evidence through which
you may secure your own proof through experimentation, and in doing so, we
shall answer both of these questions.
"GENIUS" IS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE
SIXTH SENSE
The reality of a "sixth sense" has been fairly well established. This sixth
sense is "Creative Imagination." The faculty of creative imagination is one which
the majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if used at all, it
usually happens by mere accident. A relatively small number of people use,
WITH DELIBERATION AND PURPOSE AFORETHOUGHT, the faculty of
creative imagination. Those who use this faculty voluntarily, and with
understanding of its functions, are GENII.
The faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the finite
mind of man and Infinite Intelligence. All so-called revelations, referred to in the
realm of religion, and all discoveries of basic or new principles in the field of
invention, take place through the faculty of creative imagination.
When ideas or concepts flash into one's mind, through what is popularly
called a "hunch," they come from one or more of the following sources:—
1. Infinite Intelligence
2. One's subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense
impression and thought impulse which ever reached the brain
through any of the five senses
3. From the mind of some other person who has just released the
thought, or picture of the idea or concept, through conscious
thought, or
4. From the other person's subconscious storehouse.


There are no other KNOWN sources from which "inspired" ideas or
"hunches" may be received.
The creative imagination functions best when the mind is vibrating (due
to some form of mind stimulation) at an exceedingly high rate. That is, when the
mind is functioning at a rate of vibration higher than that of ordinary, normal
thought.
When brain action has been stimulated, through one or more of the ten
mind stimulants, it has the effect of lifting the individual far above the horizon of
ordinary thought, and permits him to envision distance, scope, and quality of
THOUGHTS not available on the lower plane, such as that occupied while one is
engaged in the solution of the problems of business and professional routine.
When lifted to this higher level of thought, through any form of mind
stimulation, an individual occupies, relatively, the same position as one who has
ascended in an airplane to a height from which he may see over and beyond the
horizon line which limits his vision, while on the ground. Moreover, while on
this higher level of thought, the individual is not hampered or bound by any of
the stimuli which circumscribe and limit his vision while wrestling with the
problems of gaining the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. He
is in a world of thought in which the ORDINARY, work-a-day thoughts have
been as effectively removed as are the hills and valleys and other limitations of
physical vision, when he rises in an airplane.
While on this exalted plane of THOUGHT, the creative faculty of the mind
is given freedom for action. The way has been cleared for the sixth sense to
function, it becomes receptive to ideas which could not reach the individual
under any other circumstances. The "sixth sense" is the faculty which marks the
difference between a genius and an ordinary individual.
The creative faculty becomes more alert and receptive to vibrations,
originating outside the individual's subconscious mind, the more this faculty is
used, and the more the individual relies upon it, and makes demands upon it for
thought impulses. This faculty can be cultivated and developed only through
use.
That which is known as ones conscience operates entirely through the
faculty of the sixth sense.
The great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great, because they
acquire the habit of relying upon the "still small voice" which speaks from within,
through the faculty of creative imagination. It is a fact well known to people who
have "keen" imaginations that their best ideas come through so-called "hunches."

There is a great orator who does not attain to greatness, until he closes his
eyes and begins to rely entirely upon the faculty of Creative Imagination. When
asked why he closed his eyes just before the climaxes of his oratory, he replied, "I
do it, because, then I speak through ideas which come to me from within."
One of America's most successful and best known financiers followed the
habit of closing his eyes for two or three minutes before making a decision.
When asked why he did this, he replied, "With my eyes closed, I am able
to draw upon a source of superior intelligence."
The late Dr. Elmer R. Gates, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, created more than
200 useful patents, many of them basic, through the process of cultivating and
using the creative faculty. His method is both significant and interesting to one
interested in attaining to the status of genius, in which category Dr. Gates,
unquestionably belonged. Dr. Gates was one of the really great, though less
publicized scientists of the world.
In his laboratory, he had what he called his "personal communication
room." It was practically sound proof, and so arranged that all light could be shut
out. It was equipped with a small table, on which he kept a pad of writing paper.
In front of the table, on the wall, was an electric pushbutton, which controlled the
lights. When Dr. Gates desired to draw upon the forces available to him through
his Creative Imagination, he would go into this room, seat himself at the table,
shut off the lights, and CONCENTRATE upon the KNOWN factors of the
invention on which he was working, remaining in that position until ideas began
to "flash" into his mind in connection with the UNKNOWN factors of the
invention.
On one occasion, ideas came through so fast that he was forced to write
for almost three hours. When the thoughts stopped flowing, and he examined his
notes, he found they contained a minute description of principles which bad not
a parallel among the known data of the scientific world.
Moreover, the answer to his problem was intelligently presented in those
notes. In this manner Dr. Gates completed over 200 patents, which had been
begun, but not completed, by "half-baked" brains. Evidence of the truth of this
statement is in the United States Patent Office.
Dr. Gates earned his living by "sitting for ideas" for individuals and
corporations. Some of the largest corporations in America paid him substantial
fees, by the hour, for "sitting for ideas."
The reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by one's
accumulated experience. Not all knowledge, which one accumulates through

"experience," is accurate. Ideas received through the creative faculty are much
more reliable, for the reason that they come from sources more reliable than any
which are available to the reasoning faculty of the mind.
The major difference between the genius and the ordinary "crank"
inventor, may be found in the fact that the genius works through his faculty of
creative imagination, while the "crank" knows nothing of this faculty. The
scientific inventor (such as Mr. Edison, and Dr. Gates), makes use of both the
synthetic and the creative faculties of imagination.
For example, the scientific inventor, or "genius, begins an invention by
organizing and combining the known ideas, or principles accumulated through
experience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning faculty). If he finds this
accumulated knowledge to be insufficient for the completion of his invention, he
then draws upon the sources of knowledge available to him through his creative
faculty. The method by which he does this varies with the individual, but this is
the sum and substance of his procedure:
1.
HE STIMULATES HIS MIND SO THAT IT VIBRATES ON A HIGHERTHAN-AVERAGE PLANE, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or
some other stimulant of his choice.
2.
HE CONCENTRATES upon the known factors (the finished part) of his
invention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the
unfinished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been
taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL
thought, and waits for his answer to "flash" into his mind.
Sometimes the results are both definite and immediate. At other times, the
results are negative, depending upon the state of development of the "sixth
sense," or creative faculty.
Mr. Edison tried out more than 10,000 different combinations of ideas
through the synthetic faculty of his imagination before he "tuned in" through the
creative faculty, and got the answer which perfected the incandescent light. His
experience was similar when he produced the talking machine.
There is plenty of reliable evidence that the faculty of creative imagination
exists. This evidence is available through accurate analysis of men who have
become leaders in their respective callings, without having had extensive
educations. Lincoln was a notable example of a great leader who achieved
greatness, through the discovery, and use of his faculty of creative imagination.

He discovered, and began to use this faculty as the result of the stimulation of
love which he experienced after he met Anne Rutledge, a statement of the
highest significance, in connection with the study of the source of genius.
The pages of history are filled with the records of great leaders whose
achievements may be traced directly to the influence of women who aroused the
creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire. Napoleon
Bonaparte was one of these. When inspired by his first wife, Josephine, he was
irresistible and invincible. When his "better judgment" or reasoning faculty
prompted him to put Josephine aside, he began to decline. His defeat and St.
Helena were not far distant.
If good taste would permit, we might easily mention scores of men, well
known to the American people, who climbed to great heights of achievement
under the stimulating influence of their wives, only to drop back to destruction
AFTER money and power went to their heads, and they put aside the old wife
for a new one. Napoleon was not the only man to discover that sex influence,
from the right source, is more powerful than any substitute of expediency, which
may be created by mere reason.
The human mind responds to stimulation!
Among the greatest, and most powerful of these stimuli is the urge of sex.
When harnessed and transmuted, this driving force is capable of lifting men into
that higher sphere of thought which enables them to master the sources of worry
and petty annoyance which beset their pathway on the lower plane.
Unfortunately, only the genii have made the discovery. Others have
accepted the experience of sex urge, without discovering one of its major
potentialities— a fact which accounts for the great number of "others" as
compared to the limited number of genii.
For the purpose of refreshing the memory, in connection with the facts
available from the biographies of certain men, we here present the names of a
few men of outstanding achievement, each of whom was known to have been of
a highly sexed nature. The genius which was their's, undoubtedly found its
source of power in transmuted sex energy:
GEORGE WASHINGTON
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
RALPH WALDO EMERSON

ROBERT BURNS
THOMAS JEFFERSON
ELBERT HUBBARD
ELBERT H. GARY
OSCAR WILDE
WOODROW WILSON
JOHN H. PATTERSON
ANDREW JACKSON
ENRICO CARUSO
Your own knowledge of biography will enable you to add to this list.
Find, if you can, a single man, in all history of civilization, who achieved
outstanding success in any calling, who was not driven by a well developed sex
nature.
If you do not wish to rely upon biographies of men not now living, take
inventory of those whom you know to be men of great achievement, and see if
you can find one among them who is not highly sexed.
Sex energy is the creative energy of all genii. There never has been, and never
will be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this driving force of sex.
Surely no one will misunderstand these statements to mean that ALL who
are highly sexed are genii! Man attains to the status of a genius ONLY when, and
IF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces available, through the
creative faculty of the imagination. Chief among the stimuli with which this
"stepping up" of the vibrations may be produced is sex energy. The mere
possession of this energy is not sufficient to produce a genius. The energy must be
transmuted from desire for physical contact, into some other form of desire and
action, before it will lift one to the status of a genius.
Far from becoming genii, because of great sex desires, the majority of men
lower themselves, through misunderstanding and misuse of this great force, to
the status of the lower animals.
WHY MEN SELDOM SUCCEED BEFORE FORTY
I discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men who
succeed in an outstanding way, seldom do so before the age of forty, and more
often they do not strike their real pace until they are well beyond the age of fifty.

This fact was so astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause
most carefully, carrying the investigation over a period of more than twelve
years.
This study disclosed the fact that the major reason why the majority of
men who succeed do not begin to do so before the age of forty to fifty, is their
tendency to DISSIPATE their energies through over indulgence in physical
expression of the emotion of sex. The majority of men never learn that the urge of
sex has other possibilities, which far transcend in importance, that of mere
physical expression. The majority of those who make this discovery, do so after
having wasted many years at a period when the sex energy is at its height, prior to
the age of forty-five to fifty. This usually is followed by noteworthy achievement.
The lives of many men up to, and sometimes well past the age of forty,
reflect a continued dissipation of energies, which could have been more
profitably turned into better channels. Their finer and more powerful emotions
are sown wildly to the four winds. Out of this habit of the male, grew the term,
"sowing his wild oats."
The desire for sexual expression is by far the strongest and most impelling
of all the human emotions, and for this very reason this desire, when harnessed
and transmuted into action, other than that of physical expression, may raise one
to the status of a genius.
One of America's most able business men frankly admitted that his
attractive secretary was responsible for most of the plans he created. He admitted
that her presence lifted him to heights of creative imagination, such as he could
experience under no other stimulus.
One of the most successful men in America owes most of his success to the
influence of a very charming young woman, who has served as his source of
inspiration for more than twelve years. Everyone knows the man to whom this
reference is made, but not everyone knows the REAL SOURCE of his
achievements.
History is not lacking in examples of men who attained to the status of
genii, as the result of the use of artificial mind stimulants in the form of alcohol
and narcotics. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the "Raven" while under the influence of
liquor, "dreaming dreams that mortal never dared to dream before." James
Whitcomb Riley did his best writing while under the influence of alcohol.
Perhaps it was thus he saw "the ordered intermingling of the real and the dream,
the mill above the river, and the mist above the stream." Robert Burns wrote best


when intoxicated, "For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, we'll take a cup of kindness
yet, for Auld Lang Syne."
But let it be remembered that many such men have destroyed themselves
in the end. Nature has prepared her own potions with which men may safely
stimulate their minds so they vibrate on a plane that enables them to tune in to
fine and rare thoughts which come from— no man knows where! No satisfactory
substitute for Nature's stimulants has ever been found.
It is a fact well known to psychologists that there is a very close
relationship between sex desires and spiritual urges— a fact which accounts for
the peculiar behavior of people who participate in the orgies known as religious
"revivals," common among the primitive types.
The world is ruled, and the destiny of civilization is established, by the
human emotions. People are influenced in their actions, not by reason so much as
by "feelings." The creative faculty of the mind is set into action entirely by
emotions, and not by cold reason. The most powerful of all human emotions is that
of sex. There are other mind stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no
one of them, nor all of them combined, can equal the driving power of sex.
A mind stimulant is any influence which will either temporarily, or
permanently, increase the vibrations of thought. The ten major stimulants,
described, are those most commonly resorted to. Through these sources one may
commune with Infinite Intelligence, or enter, at will, the storehouse of the
subconscious mind, either one's own, or that of another person, a procedure
which is all there is of genius.
A teacher, who has trained and directed the efforts of more than 30,000
sales people, made the astounding discovery that highly sexed men are the most
efficient salesmen. The explanation is, that the factor of personality known as
"personal magnetism" is nothing more nor less than sex energy. Highly sexed
people always have a plentiful supply of magnetism. Through cultivation and
understanding, this vital force may be drawn upon and used to great advantage
in the relationships between people. This energy may be communicated to others
through the following media:
1.
The hand-shake. The touch of the hand indicates, instantly, the presence of
magnetism, or the lack of it.
2.
The tone of voice. Magnetism, or sex energy, is the factor with which the
voice may be colored, or made musical and charming.


3.
Posture and carriage of the body. Highly sexed people move briskly, and
with grace and ease.
4.
The vibrations of thought. Highly sexed people mix the emotion of sex
with their thoughts, or may do so at will, and in that way, may influence those
around them.
5.
Body adornment. People who are highly sexed are usually very careful
about their personal appearance. They usually select clothing of a style becoming
to their personality, physique, complexion, etc.
When employing salesmen, the more capable sales manager looks for the
quality of personal magnetism as the first requirement of a salesman. People who
lack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire others with
enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is one of the most important requisites in
salesmanship, no matter what one is selling.
The public speaker, orator, preacher, lawyer, or salesman who is lacking
in sex energy is a "flop," as far as being able to influence others is concerned.
Couple with this the fact, that most people can be influenced only through an
appeal to their emotions, and you will understand the importance of sex energy
as a part of the salesman's native ability. Master salesmen attain the status of
mastery in selling, because they, either consciously, or unconsciously, transmute
the energy of sex into SALES ENTHUSIASM! In this statement may be found a
very practical suggestion as to the actual meaning of sex transmutation.
The salesman who knows how to take his mind off the subject of sex, and
direct it in sales effort with as much enthusiasm and determination as he would
apply to its original purpose, has acquired the art of sex transmutation, whether
he knows it or not. The majority of salesmen who transmute their sex energy do
so without being in the least aware of what they are doing, or how they are doing
it.
Transmutation of sex energy calls for more will power than the average
person cares to use for this purpose. Those who find it difficult to summon willpower sufficient for transmutation, may gradually acquire this ability. Though
this requires will-power, the reward for the practice is more than worth the
effort.
The entire subject of sex is one with which the majority of people appear
to be unpardonably ignorant. The urge of sex has been grossly misunderstood,
slandered, and burlesqued by the ignorant and the evil minded, for so long that
the very word sex is seldom used in polite society. Men and women who are

known to be blessed— yes, BLESSED—with highly sexed natures, are usually
looked upon as being people who will bear watching. Instead of being called
blessed, they are usually called cursed.
Millions of people, even in this age of enlightenment, have inferiority
complexes which they developed because of this false belief that a highly sexed
nature is a curse. These statements, of the virtue of sex energy, should not be
construed as justification for the libertine. The emotion of sex is a virtue ONLY
when used intelligently, and with discrimination. It may be misused, and often
is, to such an extent that it debases, instead of enriches, both body and mind. The
better use of this power is the burden of this chapter.
It seemed quite significant to the author, when he made the discovery that
practically every great leader, whom he had the privilege of analyzing, was a
man whose achievements were largely inspired by a woman. In many instances,
the "woman in the case" was a modest, self-denying wife, of whom the public
had heard but little or nothing. In a few instances, the source of inspiration has
been traced to the "other woman." Perhaps such cases may not be entirely
unknown to you.
Intemperance in sex habits is just as detrimental as intemperance in habits
of drinking and eating. In this age in which we live, an age which began with the
world war, intemperance in habits of sex is common. This orgy of indulgence
may account for the shortage of great leaders. No man can avail himself of the
forces of his creative imagination, while dissipating them. Man is the only
creature on earth which violates Nature's purpose in this connection. Every other
animal indulges its sex nature in moderation, and with purpose which
harmonizes with the laws of nature. Every other animal responds to the call of
sex only in "season." Man's inclination is to declare "open season."
Every intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through
alcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys the vital
organs of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however, that
over indulgence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as
detrimental to creative effort as narcotics or liquor.
A sex-mad man is not essentially different than a dope-mad man! Both
have lost control over their faculties of reason and will-power. Sexual
overindulgence may not only destroy reason and will-power, but it may also
lead to either temporary, or permanent insanity. Many cases of hypochondria
(imaginary illness) grow out of habits developed in ignorance of the true
function of sex.

From these brief references to the subject, it may be readily seen that
ignorance on the subject of sex transmutation, forces stupendous penalties upon
the ignorant on the one hand, and withholds from them equally stupendous
benefits, on the other.
Widespread ignorance on the subject of sex is due to the fact that the
subject has been surrounded with mystery and beclouded by dark silence. The
conspiracy of mystery and silence has had the same effect upon the minds of
young people that the psychology of prohibition had. The result has been
increased curiosity, and desire to acquire more knowledge on this "verboten"
subject; and to the shame of all lawmakers, and most physicians— by training
best qualified to educate youth on that subject-information has not been easily
available.
Seldom does an individual enter upon highly creative effort in any field of
endeavor before the age of forty. The average man reaches the period of his
greatest capacity to create between forty and sixty. These statements are based
upon analysis of thousands of men and women who have been carefully
observed. They should be encouraging to those who fail to arrive before the age
of forty, and to those who become frightened at the approach of "old age,"
around the forty-year mark. The years between forty and fifty are, as a rule, the
most fruitful. Man should approach this age, not with fear and trembling, but
with hope and eager anticipation.
If you want evidence that most men do not begin to do their best work
before the age of forty, study the records of the most successful men known to
the American people, and you will find it. Henry Ford had not "hit his pace" of
achievement until he had passed the age of forty. Andrew Carnegie was well
past forty before he began to reap the reward of his efforts. James J. Hill was still
running a telegraph key at the age of forty. His stupendous achievements took
place after that age. Biographies of American industrialists and financiers are
filled with evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age
of man.
Between the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn (if he ever
learns), the art of sex transmutation. This discovery is generally accidental, and
more often than otherwise, the man who makes it is totally unconscious of his
discovery. He may observe that his powers of achievement have increased
around the age of thirty-five to forty, but in most cases, he is not familiar with the
cause of this change; that Nature begins to harmonize the emotions of love and


sex in the individual, between the ages of thirty and forty, so that he may draw
upon these great forces, and apply them jointly as stimuli to action.
Sex, alone, is a mighty urge to action, but its forces are like a cyclone—
they are often uncontrollable. When the emotion of love begins to mix itself with
the emotion of sex, the result is calmness of purpose, poise, accuracy of
judgment, and balance. What person, who has attained to the age of forty, is so
unfortunate as to be unable to analyze these statements, and to corroborate them
by his own experience?
When driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the
emotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is, capable of great achievement, but
his actions may be disorganized, distorted, and totally destructive. When driven
by his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may
steal, cheat, and even commit murder. But when the emotion of LOVE is mixed
with the emotion of sex, that same man will guide his actions with more sanity,
balance, and reason.
Criminologists have discovered that the most hardened criminals can be
reformed through the influence of a woman's love. There is no record of a
criminal having been reformed solely through the sex influence. These facts are
well known, but their cause is not. Reformation comes, if at all, through the heart,
or the emotional side of man, not through his head, or reasoning side.
Reformation means, "a change of heart." It does not mean a "change of head." A
man may, because of reason, make certain changes in his personal conduct to
avoid the consequences of undesirable effects, but GENUINE REFORMATION
comes only through a change of heart—through a DESIRE to change.
Love, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to
heights of super achievement. Love is the emotion which serves as a safety valve,
and insures balance, poise, and constructive effort. When combined, these three
emotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius. There are genii, however, who
know but little of the emotion of love. Most of them may be found engaged in
some form of action which is destructive, or at least, not based upon justice and
fairness toward others. If good taste would permit, a dozen genii could be named
in the field of industry and finance, who ride ruthlessly over the rights of their
fellow men. They seem totally lacking in conscience. The reader can easily
supply his own list of such men.
The emotions are states of mind. Nature has provided man with a
"chemistry of the mind" which operates in a manner similar to the principles of
chemistry of matter. It is a well known fact that, through the aid of chemistry of

matter, a chemist may create a deadly poison by mixing certain elements, none of
which are— in themselves— harmful in the right proportions. The emotions
may, likewise, be combined so as to create a deadly poison. The emotions of sex
and jealousy, when mixed, may turn a person into an insane beast.
The presence of any one or more of the destructive emotions in the human
mind, through the chemistry of the mind, sets up a poison which may destroy
one's sense of justice and fairness. In extreme cases, the presence of any
combination of these emotions in the mind may destroy one's reason.
The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex,
love, and romance. Briefly, the process may be stated as follows:
Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in
one's mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The
mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it.
Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any
emotion, and encourage the presence of any other. Control of the mind, through
the power of will, is not difficult. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The
secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any
negative emotion presents itself in one's mind, it can be transmuted into a
positive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one's
thoughts.
THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH
VOLUNTARY SELF EFFORT! A man may attain to great heights of financial or
business achievement, solely by the driving force of sex energy, but history is
filled with evidence that he may, and usually does, carry with him certain traits
of character which rob him of the ability to either hold, or enjoy his fortune. This
is worthy of analysis, thought, and meditation, for it states a truth, the
knowledge of which may be helpful to women as well as men. Ignorance of this
has cost thousands of people their privilege of HAPPINESS, even though they
possessed riches.
The emotions of love and sex leave their unmistakable marks upon the
features. Moreover, these signs are so visible, that all who wish may read them.
The man who is driven by the storm of passion, based upon sex desires alone,
plainly advertises that fact to the entire world, by the expression of his eyes, and
the lines of his face. The emotion of love, when mixed with the emotion of sex,
softens, modifies, and beautifies the facial expression. No character analyst is
needed to tell you this—you may observe it for yourself.


The emotion of love brings out, and develops, the artistic and the aesthetic
nature of man. It leaves its impress upon one's very soul, even after the fire has
been subdued by time and circumstance.
Memories of love never pass. They linger, guide, and influence long after
the source of stimulation has faded. There is nothing new in this. Every person,
who has been moved by GENUINE LOVE, knows that it leaves enduring traces
upon the human heart. The effect of love endures, because love is spiritual in
nature. The man who cannot be stimulated to great heights of achievement by
love, is hopeless—he is dead, though he may seem to live.
Even the memories of love are sufficient to lift one to a higher plane of
creative effort. The major force of love may spend itself and pass away, like a fire
which has burned itself out, but it leaves behind indelible marks as evidence that
it passed that way. Its departure often prepares the human heart for a still greater
love.
Go back into your yesterdays, at times, and bathe your mind in the
beautiful memories of past love. It will soften the influence of the present worries
and annoyances. It will give you a source of escape from the unpleasant realities
of life, and maybe—who knows?—your mind will yield to you, during this
temporary retreat into the world of fantasy, ideas, or plans which may change
the entire financial or spiritual status of your life.
If you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have "loved and lost,"
perish the thought. One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely. Love is
whimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It comes
when it pleases, and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it
remains, but spend no time worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring
it back.
Dismiss, also, the thought that love never comes but once. Love may come
and go, times without number, but there are no two love experiences which
affect one in just the same way. There may be, and there usually is, one love
experience which leaves a deeper imprint on the heart than all the others, but all
love experiences are beneficial, except to the person who becomes resentful and
cynical when love makes its departure.
There should be no disappointment over love, and there would be none if
people understood the difference between the emotions of love and sex. The
major difference is that love is spiritual, while sex is biological. No experience,
which touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can possibly be harmful,
except through ignorance, or jealousy.

Love is, without question, life's greatest experience. It brings one into
communion with Infinite Intelligence. When mixed with the emotions of
romance and sex, it may lead one far up the ladder of creative effort. The
emotions of love, sex, and romance, are sides of the eternal triangle of
achievement-building genius. Nature creates genii through no other force.
Love is an emotion with many sides, shades, and colors. The love which
one feels for parents, or children is quite different from that which one feels for
one's sweetheart. The one is mixed with the emotion of sex, while the other is
not.
The love which one feels in true friendship is not the same as that felt for
one's sweetheart, parents, or children, but it, too, is a form of love.
Then, there is the emotion of love for things inanimate, such as the love of
Nature's handiwork. But the most intense and burning of all these various kinds
of love, is that experienced in the blending of the emotions of love and sex.
Marriages, not blessed with the eternal affinity of love, properly balanced and
proportioned, with sex, cannot be happy ones—and seldom endure. Love, alone,
will not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two
beautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind,
closest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane.
When the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the
obstructions between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence are
removed.
Then a genius has been born!
What a different story is this, than those usually associated with the
emotion of sex. Here is an interpretation of the emotion which lifts it out of the
commonplace, and makes of it potter's clay in the hands of God, from which He
fashions all that is beautiful and inspiring. It is an interpretation which would,
when properly understood, bring harmony out of the chaos which exists in too
many marriages. The disharmonies often expressed in the form of nagging, may
usually be traced to lack of knowledge on the subject of sex. Where love, romance
and the proper understanding of the emotion and function of sex abide, there is
no disharmony between married people.
Fortunate is the husband whose wife understands the true relationship
between the emotions of love, sex, and romance. When motivated by this holy
triumvirate, no form of labor is burdensome, because even the most lowly form
of effort takes on the nature of a labor of love.


It is a very old saying that "a man's wife may either make him or break
him," but the reason is not always understood. The "making" and "breaking" is
the result of the wife's understanding, or lack of understanding of the emotions
of love, sex, and romance.
Despite the fact that men are polygamous, by the very nature of their
biological inheritance, it is true that no woman has as great an influence on a
man as his wife, unless he is married to a woman totally unsuited to his nature. If
a woman permits her husband to lose interest in her, and become more
interested in other women, it is usually because of her ignorance, or indifference
toward the subjects of sex, love, and romance. This statement presupposes, of
course, that genuine love once existed between a man and his wife. The facts are
equally applicable to a man who permits his wife's interest in him to die.
Married people often bicker over a multitude of trivialities. If these are
analyzed accurately, the real cause of the trouble will often be found to be
indifference, or ignorance on these subjects.
Man's greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman! The hunter who
excelled during prehistoric days, before the dawn of civilization, did so, because
of his desire to appear great in the eyes of woman. Man's nature has not changed
in this respect. The "hunter" of today brings home no skins of wild animals, but
he indicates his desire for her favor by supplying fine clothes, motor cars, and
wealth. Man has the same desire to please woman that he had before the dawn of
civilization. The only thing that has changed, is his method of pleasing. Men who
accumulate large fortunes, and attain to great heights of power and fame, do so,
mainly, to satisfy their desire to please women.
Take women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most
men. It is this inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to
make or break a man.
The woman who understands man's nature and tactfully caters to it, need
have no fear of competition from other women. Men may be "giants" with
indomitable will-power when dealing with other men, but they are easily
managed by the women of their choice.
Most men will not admit that they are easily influenced by the women
they prefer, because it is in the nature of the male to want to be recognized as the
stronger of the species. Moreover, the intelligent woman recognizes this "manly
trait" and very wisely makes no issue of it.
Some men know that they are being influenced by the women of their
choice— their wives, sweethearts, mothers or sisters— but they tactfully refrain

from rebelling against the influence because they are intelligent enough to know
that NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MODIFYING
INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN. The man who does not recognize this
important truth deprives himself of the power which has done more to help men
achieve success than all other forces combined.


CHAPTER 12
THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
THE CONNECTING LINK
The Eleventh Step toward Riches
THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND consists of a field of consciousness, in
which every impulse of thought that reaches the objective mind through any of
the five senses, is classified and recorded, and from which thoughts may be
recalled or withdrawn as letters may be taken from a filing cabinet.
It receives, and files, sense impressions or thoughts, regardless of their
nature. You may VOLUNTARILY plant in your subconscious mind any plan,
thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary
equivalent. The subconscious acts first on the dominating desires which have
been mixed with emotional feeling, such as faith.
Consider this in connection with the instructions given in the chapter on
DESIRE, for taking the six steps there outlined, and the instructions given in the
chapter on the building and execution of plans, and you will understand the
importance of the thought conveyed.
THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND WORKS DAY AND NIGHT. Through a
method of procedure, unknown to man, the subconscious mind draws upon the
forces of Infinite Intelligence for the power with which it voluntarily transmutes
one's desires into their physical equivalent, making use, always of the most
practical media by which this end may be accomplished.
You cannot entirely control your subconscious mind, but you can
voluntarily hand over to it any plan, desire, or purpose which you wish
transformed into concrete form. Read, again, instructions for using the
subconscious mind, in the chapter on autosuggestion.
There is plenty of evidence to support the belief that the subconscious
mind is the connecting link between the finite mind of man and Infinite
Intelligence. It is the intermediary through which one may draw upon the forces
of Infinite Intelligence at will. It, alone, contains the secret process by which
mental impulses are modified and changed into their spiritual equivalent. It,

alone, is the medium through which prayer may be transmitted to the source
capable of answering prayer.
The possibilities of creative effort connected with the subconscious mind
are stupendous and imponderable. They inspire one with awe.
I never approach the discussion of the subconscious mind without a
feeling of littleness and inferiority due, perhaps, to the fact that man's entire
stock of knowledge on this subject is so pitifully limited. The very fact that the
subconscious mind is the medium of communication between the thinking mind
of man and Infinite Intelligence is, of itself, a thought which almost paralyzes
one's reason.
After you have accepted, as a reality, the existence of the subconscious
mind, and understand its possibilities, as a medium for transmuting your
DESIRES into their physical or monetary equivalent, you will comprehend the
full significance of the instructions given in the chapter on DESIRE. You will also
understand why you have been repeatedly admonished to MAKE YOUR
DESIRES CLEAR, AND TO REDUCE THEM TO WRITING. You will also
understand the necessity of PERSISTENCE in carrying out instructions.
The thirteen principles are the stimuli with which you acquire the ability
to reach, and to influence your subconscious mind. Do not become discouraged,
if you cannot do this upon the first attempt. Remember that the subconscious
mind may be voluntarily directed only through habit, under the directions given in
the chapter on FAITH. You have not yet had time to master faith. Be patient. Be
persistent.
A good many statements in the chapters on faith and auto-suggestion will
be repeated here, for the benefit of YOUR subconscious mind. Remember, your
subconscious mind functions voluntarily, whether you make any effort to influence it
or not. This, naturally, suggests to you that thoughts of fear and poverty, and all
negative thoughts serve as stimuli to your subconscious mind, unless, you master
these impulses and give it more desirable food upon which it may feed.
The subconscious mind will not remain idle! If you fail to plant DESIRES
in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the
result of your neglect. We have already explained that thought impulses, both
negative and positive are reaching the subconscious mind continuously, from the
four sources which were mentioned in the chapter on Sex Transmutation.
For the present, it is sufficient if you remember that you are living daily, in
the midst of all manner of thought impulses which are reaching your
subconscious mind, without your knowledge. Some of these impulses are

negative, some are positive. You are now engaged in trying to help shut off the
flow of negative impulses, and to aid in voluntarily influencing your
subconscious mind, through positive impulses of DESIRE.
When you achieve this, you will possess the key which unlocks the door
to your subconscious mind. Moreover, you will control that door so completely,
that no undesirable thought may influence your subconscious mind.
Everything which man creates, BEGINS in the form of a thought impulse.
Man can create nothing which he does not first conceive in THOUGHT. Through
the aid of the imagination, thought impulses may be assembled into plans. The
imagination, when under control, may be used for the creation of plans or
purposes that lead to success in one's chosen occupation.
All thought impulses, intended for transmutation into their physical
equivalent, voluntarily planted in the subconscious mind, must pass through the
imagination, and be mixed with faith. The "mixing" of faith with a plan, or
purpose, intended for submission to the subconscious mind, may be done ONLY
through the imagination.
From these statements, you will readily observe that voluntary use of the
subconscious mind calls for coordination and application of all the principles.
Ella Wheeler Wilcox gave evidence of her understanding of the power of
the subconscious mind when she wrote:
"You never can tell what a thought will do
In bringing you hate or love—
For thoughts are things, and their airy wings
Are swifter than carrier doves.
They follow the law of the universe—
Each thing creates its kind,
And they speed O'er the track to bring you back
Whatever went out from your mind."
Mrs. Wilcox understood the truth, that thoughts which go out from one's
mind, also imbed themselves deeply in one's subconscious mind, where they
serve as a magnet, pattern, or blueprint by which the subconscious mind is
influenced while translating them into their physical equivalent. Thoughts are
truly things, for the reason that every material thing begins in the form of
thought-energy.


The subconscious mind is more susceptible to influence by impulses of
thought mixed with "feeling" or emotion, than by those originating solely in the
reasoning portion of the mind. In fact, there is much evidence to support the
theory, that ONLY emotionalized thoughts have any ACTION influence upon
the subconscious mind. It is a well known fact that emotion or feeling, rules the
majority of people. If it is true that the subconscious mind responds more quickly
to, and is influenced more readily by thought impulses which are well mixed
with emotion, it is essential to become familiar with the more important of the
emotions. There are seven major positive emotions, and seven major negative
emotions. The negatives voluntarily inject themselves into the thought impulses,
which insure passage into the subconscious mind. The positives must be injected,
through the principle of auto-suggestion, into the thought impulses which an
individual wishes to pass on to his subconscious mind. (Instructions have been
given in the chapter on auto-suggestion.)
These emotions, or feeling impulses, may be likened to yeast in a loaf of
bread, because they constitute the ACTION element, which transforms thought
impulses from the passive to the active state. Thus may one understand why
thought impulses, which have been well mixed with emotion, are acted upon
more readily than thought impulses originating in "cold reason."
You are preparing yourself to influence and control the "inner audience"
of your subconscious mind, in order to hand over to it the DESIRE for money,
which you wish transmuted into its monetary equivalent. It is essential,
therefore, that you understand the method of approach to this "inner audience."
You must speak its language, or it will not heed your call. It understands best the
language of emotion or feeling. Let us, therefore describe here the seven major
positive emotions, and the seven major negative motions, so that you may draw
upon the positives, and avoid the negatives, when giving instructions to your
subconscious mind.
THE SEVEN MAJOR POSITIVE EMOTIONS
The emotion of DESIRE
The emotion of FAITH
The emotion of LOVE
The emotion of SEX
The emotion of ENTHUSIASM


The emotion of ROMANCE
The emotion of HOPE
There are other positive emotions, but these are the seven most powerful,
and the ones most commonly used in creative effort. Master these seven
emotions (they can be mastered only by USE), and the other positive emotions
will be at your command when you need them. Remember, in this connection,
that you are studying a book which is intended to help you develop a "money
consciousness" by filling your mind with positive emotions. One does not become
money conscious by filling one's mind with negative emotions.
THE SEVEN MAJOR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS (To
be avoided)
The emotion of FEAR
The emotion of JEALOUSY
The emotion of HATRED
The emotion of REVENGE
The emotion of GREED
The emotion of SUPERSTITION
The emotion of ANGER
Positive and negative emotions cannot occupy the mind at the same time. One or
the other must dominate. It is your responsibility to make sure that positive
emotions constitute the dominating influence of your mind. Here the law of
HABIT will come to your aid. Form the habit of applying and using the positive
emotions! Eventually, they will dominate your mind so completely, that the
negatives cannot enter it.
Only by following these instructions literally, and continuously, can you
gain control over your subconscious mind. The presence of a single negative in
your conscious mind is sufficient to destroy all chances of constructive aid from
your subconscious mind.
If you are an observing person, you must have noticed that most people
resort to prayer ONLY after everything else has FAILED! Or else they pray by a
ritual of meaningless words. And, because it is a fact that most people who pray,
do so ONLY AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE HAS FAILED, they go to prayer with
their minds filled with FEAR and DOUBT, which are the emotions the subconscious

mind acts upon, and passes on to Infinite Intelligence. Likewise, that is the
emotion which Infinite Intelligence receives, and ACTS UPON.
If you pray for a thing, but have fear as you pray, that you may not receive
it, or that your prayer will not be acted upon by Infinite Intelligence, your prayer
will have been in vain.
Prayer does, sometimes, result in the realization of that for which one
prays. If you have ever had the experience of receiving that for which YOU
prayed, go back in your memory, and recall your actual STATE OF MIND, while
you were praying, and you will know, for sure, that the theory here described is
more than a theory.
The time will come when the schools and educational institutions of the
country will teach the "science of prayer." Moreover, then prayer may be, and
will be reduced to a science. When that time comes, (it will come as soon as
mankind is ready for it, and demands it), no one will approach the Universal
Mind in a state of fear, for the very good reason that there will be no such
emotion as fear. Ignorance, superstition, and false teaching will have
disappeared, and man will have attained his true status as a child of Infinite
Intelligence. A few have already attained this blessing.
If you believe this prophesy is far-fetched, take a look at the human race in
retrospect. Less than a hundred years ago, men believed the lightning to be
evidence of the wrath of God, and feared it. Now, thanks to the power of FAITH,
men have harnessed the lightning and made it turn the wheels of industry. Much
less than a hundred years ago, men believed the space between the planets to be
nothing but a great void, a stretch of dead nothingness. Now, thanks to this same
power of FAITH, men know that far from being either dead or a void, the space
between the planets is very much alive, that it is the highest form of vibration
known, excepting, perhaps, the vibration of THOUGHT. Moreover, men know
that this living, pulsating, vibratory energy which permeates every atom of
matter, and fills every niche of space, connects every human brain with every
other human brain.
What reason have men to believe that this same energy does not connect
every human brain with Infinite Intelligence?
There are no toll-gates between the finite mind of man and Infinite
Intelligence. The communication costs nothing except Patience, Faith,
Persistence, Understanding, and a SINCERE DESIRE to communicate. Moreover,
the approach can be made only by the individual himself. Paid prayers are


worthless. Infinite Intelligence does no business by proxy. You either go direct,
or you do not communicate.
You may buy prayer books and repeat them until the day of your doom,
without avail. Thoughts which you wish to communicate to Infinite Intelligence,
must undergo transformation, such as can be given only through your own
subconscious mind.
The method by which you may communicate with Infinite Intelligence is
very similar to that through which the vibration of sound is communicated by
radio. If you understand the working principle of radio, you of course, know that
sound cannot be communicated through the ether until it has been "stepped up,"
or changed into a rate of vibration which the human ear cannot detect. The radio
sending station picks up the sound of the human voice, and "scrambles," or
modifies it by stepping up the vibration millions of times. Only in this way, can
the vibration of sound be communicated through the ether. After this
transformation has taken place, the ether "picks up" the energy (which originally
was in the form of vibrations of sound), carries that energy to radio receiving
stations, and these receiving sets "step" that energy back down to its original rate
of vibration so it is recognized as sound.
The subconscious mind is the intermediary, which translates one's prayers
into terms which Infinite Intelligence can recognize, presents the message, and
brings back the answer in the form of a definite plan or idea for procuring the
object of the prayer. Understand this principle, and you will know why mere
words read from a prayer book cannot, and will never serve as an agency of
communication between the mind of man and Infinite Intelligence.
Before your prayer will reach Infinite Intelligence (a statement of the
author's theory only), it probably is transformed from its original thought
vibration into terms of spiritual vibration. Faith is the only known agency which
will give your thoughts a spiritual nature. FAITH and FEAR make poor
bedfellows. Where one is found, the other cannot exist.


CHAPTER 13
THE BRAIN
A BROADCASTING AND RECEIVING STATION FOR THOUGHT
The Twelfth Step toward Riches
MORE than twenty years ago, the author, working in conjunction with the
late Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, and Dr. Elmer R. Gates, observed that every
human brain is both a broadcasting and receiving station for the vibration of
thought.
Through the medium of the ether, in a fashion similar to that employed by
the radio broadcasting principle, every human brain is capable of picking up
vibrations of thought which are being released by other brains.
In connection with the statement in the preceding paragraph, compare,
and consider the description of the Creative Imagination, as outlined in the
chapter on Imagination. The Creative Imagination is the "receiving set" of the
brain, which receives thoughts, released by the brains of others. It is the agency
of communication between one's conscious, or reasoning mind, and the four
sources from which one may receive thought stimuli.
When stimulated, or "stepped up" to a high rate of vibration, the mind
becomes more receptive to the vibration of thought which reaches it through the
ether from outside sources. This "stepping up" process takes place through the
positive emotions, or the negative emotions. Through the emotions, the
vibrations of thought may be increased.
Vibrations of an exceedingly high rate are the only vibrations picked up
and carried, by the ether, from one brain to another. Thought is energy travelling
at an exceedingly high rate of vibration. Thought, which has been modified or
"stepped up" by any of the major emotions, vibrates at a much higher rate than
ordinary thought, and it is this type of thought which passes from one brain to
another, through the broadcasting machinery of the human brain.
The emotion of sex stands at the head of the list of human emotions, as far
as intensity and driving force are concerned. The brain which has been

stimulated by the emotion of sex, vibrates at a much more rapid rate than it does
when that emotion is quiescent or absent.
The result of sex transmutation, is the increase of the rate of vibration of
thoughts to such a pitch that the Creative Imagination becomes highly receptive
to ideas, which it picks up from the ether. On the other hand, when the brain is
vibrating at a rapid rate, it not only attracts thoughts and ideas released by other
brains through the medium of the ether, but it gives to one's own thoughts that
"feeling" which is essential before those thoughts will be picked up and acted
upon by one's subconscious mind.
Thus, you will see that the broadcasting principle is the factor through
which you mix feeling, or emotion with your thoughts and pass them on to your
subconscious mind.
The subconscious mind is the "sending station" of the brain, through
which vibrations of thought are broadcast. The Creative Imagination is the
"receiving set," through which the vibrations of thought are picked up from the
ether.
Along with the important factors of the subconscious mind, and the
faculty of the Creative Imagination, which constitute the sending and receiving
sets of your mental broadcasting machinery, consider now the principle of autosuggestion, which is the medium by which you may put into operation your
"broadcasting" station.
Through the instructions described in the chapter on auto-suggestion, you
were definitely informed of the method by which DESIRE may be transmuted
into its monetary equivalent.
Operation of your mental "broadcasting" station is a comparatively simple
procedure. You have but three principles to bear in mind, and to apply, when
you wish to use your broadcasting station—the SUBCONSCIOUS MIND,
CREATIVE IMAGINATION, and AUTO-SUGGESTION. The stimuli through
which you put these three principles into action have been described— the
procedure begins with DESIRE.
THE GREATEST FORCES ARE "INTANGIBLE"
The depression brought the world to the very border-line of
understanding of the forces which are intangible and unseen. Through the ages
which have passed, man has depended too much upon his physical senses, and


has limited his knowledge to physical things, which he could see, touch, weigh,
and measure.
We are now entering the most marvelous of all ages—an age which will
teach us something of the intangible forces of the world about us. Perhaps we
shall learn, as we pass through this age, that the "other self" is more powerful
than the physical self we see when we look into a mirror.
Sometimes men speak lightly of the intangibles— the things which they
cannot perceive through any of their five senses, and when we hear them, it
should remind us that all of us are controlled by forces which are unseen and
intangible.
The whole of mankind has not the power to cope with, nor to control the
intangible force wrapped up in the rolling waves of the oceans. Man has not the
capacity to understand the intangible force of gravity, which keeps this little
earth suspended in mid-air, and keeps man from falling from it, much less the
power to control that force. Man is entirely subservient to the intangible force
which comes with a thunder storm, and he is just as helpless in the presence of
the intangible force of electricity— nay, he does not even know what electricity
is, where it comes from, or what is its purpose!
Nor is this by any means the end of man's ignorance in connection with
things unseen and intangible. He does not understand the intangible force (and
intelligence) wrapped up in the soil of the earth— the force which provides him
with every morsel of food he eats, every article of clothing he wears, every dollar he
carries in his pockets.
THE DRAMATIC STORY OF THE BRAIN
Last, but not least, man, with all of his boasted culture and education,
understands little or nothing of the intangible force (the greatest of all the
intangibles) of thought. He knows but little concerning the physical brain, and its
vast network of intricate machinery through which the power of thought is
translated into its material equivalent, but he is now entering an age which shall
yield enlightenment on the subject. Already men of science have begun to turn
their attention to the study of this stupendous thing called a brain, and, while
they are still in the kindergarten stage of their studies, they have uncovered
enough knowledge to know that the central switchboard of the human brain, the
number of lines which connect the brain cells one with another, equal the figure
one, followed by fifteen million ciphers.

"The figure is so stupendous," said Dr. C. Judson Herrick, of the
University of Chicago, "that astronomical figures dealing with hundreds of
millions of light years, become insignificant by comparison.
It has been determined that there are from 10,000,000,000 to 14,000,000,000
nerve cells in the human cerebral cortex, and we know that these are arranged in
definite patterns. These arrangements are not haphazard. They are orderly.
Recently developed methods of electro-physiology draw off action currents from
very precisely located cells, or fibers with micro-electrodes, amplify them with
radio tubes, and record potential differences to a millionth of a volt."
It is inconceivable that such a network of intricate machinery should be in
existence for the sole purpose of carrying on the physical functions incidental to
growth and maintenance of the physical body. Is it not likely that the same
system, which gives billions of brain cells the media for communication one with
another, provides, also the means of communication with other intangible forces?
After this book had been written, just before the manuscript went to the
publisher, there appeared in the New York Times, an editorial showing that at
least one great University, and one intelligent investigator in the field of mental
phenomena, are carrying on an organized research through which conclusions
have been reached that parallel many of those described in this and the following
chapter. The editorial briefly analyzed the work carried on by Dr. Rhine, and his
associates at Duke University, viz:—"What is 'Telepathy'?
"A month ago we cited on this page some of the remarkable results
achieved by Professor Rhine and his associates in Duke University from more
than a hundred thousand tests to determine the existence of 'telepathy' and
'clairvoyance.' These results were summarized in the first two articles in Harpers
Magazine. In the second which has now appeared, the author, E. H. Wright,
attempts to summarize what has been learned, or what it seems reasonable to
infer, regarding the exact nature of these 'extrasensory' modes of perception.
"The actual existence of telepathy and clairvoyance now seems to some
scientists enormously probable as the result of Rhine's experiments. Various
percipients were asked to name as many cards in a special pack as they could
without looking at them and without other sensory access to them. About a score
of men and women were discovered who could regularly name so many of the
cards correctly that 'there was not one chance in many a million million of their
having done their feats by luck or accident.'
"But how did they do them? These powers, assuming that they exist, do
not seem to be sensory. There is no known organ for them. The experiments

worked just as well at distances of several hundred miles as they did in the same
room. These facts also dispose, in Mr. Wright's opinion, of the attempt to explain
telepathy or clairvoyance through any physical theory of radiation. All known
forms of radiant energy decline inversely as the square of the distance traversed.
Telepathy and clairvoyance do not. But they do vary through physical causes as
our other mental powers do. Contrary to widespread opinion, they do not
improve when the percipient is asleep or half-asleep, but, on the contrary, when
he is most wide-awake and alert. Rhine discovered that a narcotic will invariably
lower a percipient's score, while a stimulant will always send it higher. The most
reliable performer apparently cannot make a good score unless he tries to do his
best.
"One conclusion that Wright draws with some confidence is that telepathy
and clairvoyance are really one and the same gift. That is, the faculty that 'sees' a
card face down on a table seems to be exactly the same one that 'reads' a thought
residing only in another mind. There are several grounds for believing this. So
far, for example, the two gifts have been found in every person who enjoys either
of them. In every one so far the two have been of equal vigor, almost exactly.
Screens, walls, distances, have no effect at all on either. Wright advances from
this conclusion to express what he puts forward as no more than the mere
'hunch' that other extra-sensory experiences, prophetic dreams, premonitions of
disaster, and the like, may also prove to be part of the same faculty. The reader is
not asked to accept any of these conclusions unless he finds it necessary, but the
evidence that Rhine has piled up must remain impressive."
In view of Dr. Rhine's announcement in connection with the conditions
under which the mind responds to what he terms extra—sensory modes of
perception, I now feel privileged to add to his testimony by stating that my
associates and I have discovered what we believe to be the ideal conditions
under which the mind can be stimulated so that the sixth sense described in the
next chapter, can be made to function in a practical way.
The conditions to which I refer consist of a close working alliance between
myself and two members of my staff. Through experimentation and practice, we
have discovered how to stimulate our minds (by applying the principle used in
connection with the "Invisible Counselors" described in the next chapter) so that
we can, by a process of blending our three minds into one, find the solution to a
great variety of personal problems which are submitted by my clients.
The procedure is very simple. We sit down at a conference table, clearly
state the nature of the problem we have under consideration, then begin

discussing it. Each contributes whatever thoughts that may occur. The strange
thing about this method of mind stimulation is that it places each participant in
communication with unknown sources of knowledge definitely outside his own
experience.
If you understand the principle described in the chapter on the Master
Mind, you of course recognize the round-table procedure here described as being
a practical application of the Master Mind.
This method of mind stimulation, through harmonious discussion of
definite subjects, between three people, illustrates the simplest and most practical
use of the Master Mind.
By adopting and following a similar plan any student of this philosophy may
come into possession of the famous Carnegie formula briefly described in the
introduction. If it means nothing to you at this time, mark this page and read it
again after you have finished the last chapter.


THE "depression" was a blessing in disguise.
It reduced the whole world to a new starting-point
that gives every one a new opportunity.


CHAPTER 14
THE SIXTH SENSE
THE DOOR TO THE TEMPLE OF WISDOM
The Thirteenth Step toward Riches
THE "thirteenth" principle is known as the SIXTH SENSE, through which
Infinite Intelligence may, and will communicate voluntarily, without any effort
from, or demands by, the individual.
This principle is the apex of the philosophy. It can be assimilated,
understood, and applied ONLY by first mastering the other twelve principles.
The SIXTH SENSE is that portion of the subconscious mind which has
been referred to as the Creative Imagination. It has also been referred to as the
"receiving set" through which ideas, plans, and thoughts flash into the mind. The
"flashes" are sometimes called "hunches" or "inspirations."
The sixth sense defies description! It cannot be described to a person who
has not mastered the other principles of this philosophy, because such a person
has no knowledge, and no experience with which the sixth sense may be
compared. Understanding of the sixth sense comes only by meditation through
mind development from within. The sixth sense probably is the medium of
contact between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence, and for this
reason, it is a mixture of both the mental and the spiritual. It is believed to be the
point at which the mind of man contacts the Universal Mind.
After you have mastered the principles described in this book, you will be
prepared to accept as truth a statement which may, otherwise, be incredible to
you, namely:
Through the aid of the sixth sense, you will be warned of impending
dangers in time to avoid them, and notified of opportunities in time to embrace
them.
There comes to your aid, and to do your bidding, with the development of
the sixth sense, a "guardian angel" who will open to you at all times the door to
the Temple of Wisdom.

Whether or not this is a statement of truth, you will never know, except by
following the instructions described in the pages of this book, or some similar
method of procedure.
The author is not a believer in, nor an advocate of "miracles," for the
reason that he has enough knowledge of Nature to understand that Nature never
deviates from her established laws. Some of her laws are so incomprehensible that
they produce what appear to be "miracles." The sixth sense comes as near to
being a miracle as anything I have ever experienced, and it appears so, only
because I do not understand the method by which this principle is operated.
This much the author does know— that there is a power, or a First Cause,
or an Intelligence, which permeates every atom of matter, and embraces every
unit of energy perceptible to man— that this Infinite Intelligence converts acorns
into oak trees, causes water to flow down hill in response to the law of gravity,
follows night with day, and winter with summer, each maintaining its proper
place and relationship to the other. This Intelligence may, through the principles
of this philosophy, be induced to aid in transmuting DESIRES into concrete, or
material form. The author has this knowledge, because he has experimented with
it— and has EXPERIENCED IT.
Step by step, through the preceding chapters, you have been led to this,
the last principle. If you have mastered each of the preceding principles, you are
now prepared to accept, without being skeptical, the stupendous claims made here.
If you have not mastered the other principles, you must do so before you may
determine, definitely, whether or not the claims made in this chapter are fact or
fiction.
While I was passing through the age of "hero-worship" I found myself
trying to imitate those whom I most admired. Moreover, I discovered that the
element of FAITH, with which I endeavored to imitate my idols, gave me great
capacity to do so quite successfully.
I have never entirely divested myself of this habit of hero-worship,
although I have passed the age commonly given over to such. My experience has
taught me that the next best thing to being truly great, is to emulate the great, by
feeling and action, as nearly as possible.
Long before I had ever written a line for publication, or endeavored to
deliver a speech in public, I followed the habit of reshaping my own character,
by trying to imitate the nine men whose lives and life-works had been most
impressive to me. These nine men were, Emerson, Paine, Edison, Darwin,
Lincoln, Burbank, Napoleon, Ford, and Carnegie.

Every night, over a long period of years, I held an imaginary Council
meeting with this group whom I called my "Invisible Counselors."
The procedure was this. Just before going to sleep at night, I would shut
my eyes, and see, in my imagination, this group of men seated with me around
my Council Table. Here I had not only an opportunity to sit among those whom I
considered to be great, but I actually dominated the group, by serving as the
Chairman.
I had a very DEFINITE PURPOSE in indulging my imagination through
these nightly meetings. My purpose was to rebuild my own character so it would
represent a composite of the characters of my imaginary counselors. Realizing, as
I did, early in life, that I had to overcome the handicap of birth in an environment
of ignorance and superstition, I deliberately assigned myself the task of
voluntary rebirth through the method here described.
BUILDING CHARACTER THROUGH AUTO-SUGGESTION
Being an earnest student of psychology, I knew, of course, that all men
have become what they are, because of their DOMINATING THOUGHTS AND
DESIRES. I knew that every deeply seated desire has the effect of causing one to
seek outward expression through which that desire may be transmuted into
reality. I knew that self-suggestion is a powerful factor in building character, that
it is, in fact, the sole principle through which character is builded.
With this knowledge of the principles of mind operation, I was fairly well
armed with the equipment needed in rebuilding my character. In these
imaginary Council meetings I called on my Cabinet members for the knowledge
I wished each to contribute, addressing myself to each member in audible words,
as follows:
"Mr. Emerson, I desire to acquire from you the marvelous understanding
of Nature which distinguished your life. I ask that you make an impress upon
my subconscious mind, of whatever qualities you possessed, which enabled you
to understand and adapt yourself to the laws of Nature. I ask that you assist me
in reaching and drawing upon whatever sources of knowledge are available to
this end.
"Mr. Burbank, I request that you pass on to me the knowledge which
enabled you to so harmonize the laws of Nature that you caused the cactus to
shed its thorns, and become an edible food. Give me access to the knowledge
which enabled you to make two blades of grass grow where but one grew before,

and helped you to blend the coloring of the flowers with more splendor and
harmony, for you, alone, have successfully gilded the lily.
"Napoleon, I desire to acquire from you, by emulation, the marvelous
ability you possessed to inspire men, and to arouse them to greater and more
determined spirit of action. Also to acquire the spirit of enduring FAITH, which
enabled you to turn defeat into victory, and to surmount staggering obstacles.
Emperor of Fate, King of Chance, Man of Destiny, I salute you!
"Mr. Paine, I desire to acquire from you the freedom of thought and the
courage and clarity with which to express convictions, which so distinguished
you!
"Mr. Darwin, I wish to acquire from you the marvelous patience, and
ability to study cause and effect, without bias or prejudice, so exemplified by you
in the field of natural science.
"Mr. Lincoln, I desire to build into my own character the keen sense of
justice, the untiring spirit of patience, the sense of humor, the human
understanding, and the tolerance, which were your distinguishing
characteristics.
"Mr. Carnegie, I am already indebted to you for my choice of a life-work,
which has brought me great happiness and peace of mind. I wish to acquire a
thorough understanding of the principles of organized effort, which you used so
effectively in the building of a great industrial enterprise.
"Mr. Ford, you have been among the most helpful of the men who have
supplied much of the material essential to my work. I wish to acquire your spirit
of persistence, the determination, poise, and self-confidence which have enabled
you to master poverty, organize, unify, and simplify human effort, so I may help
others to follow in your footsteps.
"Mr. Edison, I have seated you nearest to me, at my right, because of the
personal cooperation you have given me, during my research into the causes of
success and failure. I wish to acquire from you the marvelous spirit of FAITH,
with which you have uncovered so many of Nature's secrets, the spirit of
unremitting toil with which you have so often wrested victory from defeat."
My method of addressing the members of the imaginary Cabinet would
vary, according to the traits of character in which I was, for the moment, most
interested in acquiring. I studied the records of their lives with painstaking care.
After some months of this nightly procedure, I was astounded by the discovery
that these imaginary figures became, apparently real.


Each of these nine men developed individual characteristics, which
surprised me. For example, Lincoln developed the habit of always being late,
then walking around in solemn parade. When he came, he walked very slowly,
with his hands clasped behind him, and once in a while, he would stop as he
passed, and rest his hand, momentarily, upon my shoulder. He always wore an
expression of seriousness upon his face. Rarely did I see him smile. The cares of a
sundered nation made him grave.
That was not true of the others. Burbank and Paine often indulged in witty
repartee which seemed, at times, to shock the other members of the cabinet. One
night Paine suggested that I prepare a lecture on "The Age of Reason," and
deliver it from the pulpit of a church which I formerly attended. Many around
the table laughed heartily at the suggestion. Not Napoleon! He drew his mouth
down at the corners and groaned so loudly that all turned and looked at him
with amazement. To him the church was but a pawn of the State, not to be
reformed, but to be used, as a convenient inciter to mass activity by the people.
On one occasion Burbank was late. When he came, he was excited with
enthusiasm, and explained that he had been late, because of an experiment he
was making, through which he hoped to be able to grow apples on any sort of
tree. Paine chided him by reminding him that it was an apple which started all
the trouble between man and woman. Darwin chuckled heartily as he suggested
that Paine should watch out for little serpents, when he went into the forest to
gather apples, as they had the habit of growing into big snakes. Emerson
observed—" No serpents, no apples," and Napoleon remarked, "No apples, no
state!"
Lincoln developed the habit of always being the last one to leave the table
after each meeting. On one occasion, he leaned across the end of the table, his
arms folded, and remained in that position for many minutes. I made no attempt
to disturb him. Finally, he lifted his head slowly, got up and walked to the door,
then turned around, came back, and laid his hand on my shoulder and said, "My
boy, you will need much courage if you remain steadfast in carrying out your
purpose in life. But remember, when difficulties overtake you, the common
people have common sense. Adversity will develop it."
One evening Edison arrived ahead of all the others. He walked over and
seated himself at my left, where Emerson was accustomed to sit, and said, "You
are destined to witness the discovery of the secret of life. When the time comes,
you will observe that life consists of great swarms of energy, or entities, each as
intelligent as human beings think themselves to be. These units of life group

together like hives of bees, and remain together until they disintegrate, through
lack of harmony.
These units have differences of opinion, the same as human beings, and
often fight among themselves. These meetings which you are conducting will be
very helpful to you. They will bring to your rescue some of the same units of life
which served the members of your Cabinet, during their lives. These units are
eternal. THEY NEVER DIE! Your own thoughts and DESIRES serve as the
magnet which attracts units of life, from the great ocean of life out there. Only the
friendly units are attracted—the ones which harmonize with the nature of your
DESIRES."
The other members of the Cabinet began to enter the room. Edison got up,
and slowly walked around to his own seat. Edison was still living when this
happened. It impressed me so greatly that I went to see him, and told him about
the experience. He smiled broadly, and said, "Your dream was more a reality
than you may imagine it to have been." He added no further explanation to his
statement.
These meetings became so realistic that I became fearful of their
consequences, and discontinued them for several months. The experiences were
so uncanny, I was afraid if I continued them I would lose sight of the fact that the
meetings were purely experiences of my imagination.
Some six months after I had discontinued the practice I was awakened one
night, or thought I was, when I saw Lincoln standing at my bedside. He said,
"The world will soon need your services. It is about to undergo a period of chaos
which will cause men and women to lose faith, and become panic stricken. Go
ahead with your work and complete your philosophy. That is your mission in
life. If you neglect it, for any cause whatsoever, you will be reduced to a primal
state, and be compelled to retrace the cycles through which you have passed
during thousands of years.
"I was unable to tell, the following morning, whether I had dreamed this,
or had actually been awake, and I have never since found out which it was, but I
do know that the dream, if it were a dream, was so vivid in my mind the next
day that I resumed my meetings the following night.
At our next meeting, the members of my Cabinet all filed into the room
together, and stood at their accustomed places at the Council Table, while
Lincoln raised a glass and said, "Gentlemen, let us drink a toast to a friend who
has returned to the fold."


After that, I began to add new members to my Cabinet, until now it
consists of more than fifty, among them Christ, St. Paul, Galileo, Copernicus,
Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Homer, Voltaire, Bruno, Spinoza, Drummond, Kant,
Schopenhauer, Newton, Confucius, Elbert Hubbard, Brann, Ingersol, Wilson, and
William James.
This is the first time that I have had the courage to mention this.
Heretofore, I have remained quiet on the subject, because I knew, from my own
attitude in connection with such matters, that I would be misunderstood if I
described my unusual experience. I have been emboldened now to reduce my
experience to the printed page, because I am now less concerned about what
"they say" than I was in the years that have passed. One of the blessings of
maturity is that it sometimes brings one greater courage to be truthful, regardless
of what those who do not understand, may think or say.
Lest I be misunderstood, I wish here to state most emphatically, that I still
regard my Cabinet meetings as being purely imaginary, but I feel entitled to
suggest that, while the members of my Cabinet may be purely fictional, and the
meetings existent only in my own imagination, they have led me into glorious
paths of adventure, rekindled an appreciation of true greatness, encouraged
creative endeavor, and emboldened the expression of honest thought.
Somewhere in the cell-structure of the brain, is located an organ which
receives vibrations of thought ordinarily called "hunches." So far, science has not
discovered where this organ of the sixth sense is located, but this is not
important. The fact remains that human beings do receive accurate knowledge,
through sources other than the physical senses. Such knowledge, generally, is
received when the mind is under the influence of extraordinary stimulation. Any
emergency which arouses the emotions, and causes the heart to beat more
rapidly than normal may, and generally does, bring the sixth sense into action.
Anyone who has experienced a near accident while driving, knows that on such
occasions, the sixth sense often comes to one's rescue, and aids, by split seconds,
in avoiding the accident.
These facts are mentioned preliminary to a statement of fact which I shall
now make, namely, that during my meetings with the "Invisible Counselors" I
find my mind most receptive to ideas, thoughts, and knowledge which reach me
through the sixth sense. I can truthfully say that I owe entirely to my "Invisible
Counselors" full credit for such ideas, facts, or knowledge as I received through
"inspiration."


On scores of occasions, when I have faced emergencies, some of them so
grave that my life was in jeopardy, I have been miraculously guided past these
difficulties through the influence of my "Invisible Counselors."
My original purpose in conducting Council meetings with imaginary
beings, was solely that of impressing my own subconscious mind, through the
principle of auto-suggestion, with certain characteristics which I desired to
acquire. In more recent years, my experimentation has taken on an entirely
different trend. I now go to my imaginary counselors with every difficult
problem which confronts me and my clients. The results are often astonishing,
although I do not depend entirely on this form of Counsel.
You, of course, have recognized that this chapter covers a subject with
which a majority of people are not familiar. The Sixth Sense is a subject that will
be of great interest and benefit to the person whose aim is to accumulate vast
wealth, but it need not claim the attention of those whose desires are more
modest.
Henry Ford, undoubtedly understands and makes practical use of the
sixth sense. His vast business and financial operations make it necessary for him
to understand and use this principle. The late Thomas A. Edison understood and
used the sixth sense in connection with the development of inventions, especially
those involving basic patents, in connection with which he had no human
experience and no accumulated knowledge to guide him, as was the case while
he was working on the talking machine, and the moving picture machine.
Nearly all great leaders, such as Napoleon, Bismark, Joan of Arc, Christ,
Buddha, Confucius, and Mohammed, understood, and probably made use of the
sixth sense almost continuously. The major portion of their greatness consisted of
their knowledge of this principle.
The sixth sense is not something that one can take off and put on at will.
Ability to use this great power comes slowly, through application of the other
principles outlined in this book. Seldom does any individual come into workable
knowledge of the sixth sense before the age of forty. More often the knowledge is
not available until one is well past fifty, and this, for the reason that the spiritual
forces, with which the sixth sense is so closely related, do not mature and become
usable except through years of meditation, self-examination, and serious
thought.
No matter who you are, or what may have been your purpose in reading
this book, you can profit by it without understanding the principle described in


this chapter. This is especially true if your major purpose is that of accumulation
of money or other material things.
The chapter on the sixth sense was included, because the book is designed
for the purpose of presenting a complete philosophy by which individuals may
unerringly guide themselves in attaining whatever they ask of life. The starting
point of all achievement is DESIRE. The finishing point is that brand of
KNOWLEDGE which leads to understanding— understanding of self,
understanding of others, understanding of the laws of Nature, recognition and
understanding of HAPPINESS.
This sort of understanding comes in its fullness only through familiarity
with, and use of the principle of the sixth sense, hence that principle had to be
included as a part of this philosophy, for the benefit of those who demand more
than money.
Having read the chapter, you must have observed that while reading it,
you were lifted to a high level of mental stimulation. Splendid! Come back to this
again a month from now, read it once more, and observe that your mind will
soar to a still higher level of stimulation. Repeat this experience from time to
time, giving no concern as to how much or how little you learn at the time, and
eventually you will find yourself in possession of a power that will enable you to
throw off discouragement, master fear, overcome procrastination, and draw
freely upon your imagination. Then you will have felt the touch of that unknown
"something" which has been the moving spirit of every truly great thinker leader,
artist, musician, writer, statesman. Then you will be in position to transmute
your DESIRES into their physical or financial counterpart as easily as you may lie
down and quit at the first sign of opposition.
FAITH VS. FEAR!
Previous chapters have described how to develop FAITH, through Autosuggestion, Desire and the Subconscious. The next chapter presents detailed
instructions for the mastery of FEAR.
Here will be found a full description of the six fears which are the cause of
all discouragement, timidity, procrastination, indifference, indecision, and the
lack of ambition, self-reliance, initiative, self-control, and enthusiasm.
Search yourself carefully as you study these six enemies, as they may exist
only in your subconscious mind, where their presence will be hard to detect.


Remember, too, as you analyze the "Six Ghosts of Fear," that they are nothing but
ghosts because they exist only in one's mind.
Remember, also, that ghosts— creations of uncontrolled imagination—
have caused most of the damage people have done to their own minds, therefore,
ghosts can be as dangerous as if they lived and walked on the earth in physical
bodies.
The Ghost of the Fear of Poverty, which seized the minds of millions of
people in 1929, was so real that it caused the worst business depression this
country has ever known. Moreover, this particular ghost still frightens some of
us out of our wits.


CHAPTER 15
HOW TO OUTWIT THE SIX GHOSTS OF FEAR
Take Inventory of Yourself, As You
Read This Closing Chapter, and Find
Out How Many of the "Ghosts" Are
Standing in Your Way
BEFORE you can put any portion of this philosophy into successful use,
your mind must be prepared to receive it. The preparation is not difficult. It
begins with study, analysis, and understanding of three enemies which you shall
have to clear out. These are INDECISION, DOUBT, and FEAR!
The Sixth Sense will never function while these three negatives, or any of
them remain in your mind. The members of this unholy trio are closely related;
where one is found, the other two are close at hand.
INDECISION is the seedling of FEAR! Remember this, as you read.
Indecision crystalizes into DOUBT, the two blend and become FEAR! The
"blending" process often is slow. This is one reason why these three enemies are
so dangerous. They germinate and grow without their presence being observed.
The remainder of this chapter describes an end which must be attained
before the philosophy, as a whole, can be put into practical use. It also analyzes a
condition which has, but lately, reduced huge numbers of people to poverty, and
it states a truth which must be understood by all who accumulate riches, whether
measured in terms of money or a state of mind of far greater value than money.
The purpose of this chapter is to turn the spotlight of attention upon the cause
and the cure of the six basic fears. Before we can master an enemy, we must
know its name, its habits, and its place of abode. As you read, analyze yourself
carefully, and determine which, if any, of the six common fears have attached
themselves to you.
Do not be deceived by the habits of these subtle enemies. Sometimes they
remain hidden in the subconscious mind, where they are difficult to locate, and
still more difficult to eliminate.


THE SIX BASIC FEARS
There are six basic fears, with some combination of which every human
suffers at one tune or another. Most people are fortunate if they do not suffer
from the entire six. Named in the order of their most common appearance, they
are:—
The fear of POVERTY
The fear of CRITICISM
The fear of ILL HEALTH

} at the bottom of
} most of one's
} worries

The fear of LOSS OF LOVE OF SOMEONE
The fear of OLD AGE
The fear of DEATH
All other fears are of minor importance, they can be grouped under these
six headings.
The prevalence of these fears, as a curse to the world, runs in cycles. For
almost six years, while the depression was on, we floundered in the cycle of
FEAR OF POVERTY. During the world-war, we were in the cycle of FEAR OF
DEATH. Just following the war, we were in the cycle of FEAR OF ILL HEALTH,
as evidenced by the epidemic of disease which spread itself all over the world.
Fears are nothing more than states of mind. One's state of mind is subject to
control and direction. Physicians, as everyone knows, are less subject to attack by
disease than ordinary laymen, for the reason that physicians DO NOT FEAR
DISEASE. Physicians, without fear or hesitation, have been known to physically
contact hundreds of people, daily, who were suffering from such contagious
diseases as small-pox, without becoming infected. Their immunity against the
disease consisted, largely, if not solely, in their absolute lack of FEAR.
Man can create nothing which he does not first conceive in the form of an
impulse of thought. Following this statement, comes another of still greater
importance, namely, MAN'S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO
TRANSLATE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT,
WHETHER THOSE THOUGHTS ARE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
Thought impulses which are picked up through the ether, by mere chance
(thoughts which have been released by other minds) may determine one's


financial, business, professional, or social destiny just as surely as do the thought
impulses which one creates by intent and design.
We are here laying the foundation for the presentation of a fact of great
importance to the person who does not understand why some people appear to
be "lucky" while others of equal or greater ability, training, experience, and brain
capacity, seem destined to ride with misfortune. This fact may be explained by
the statement that every human being has the ability to completely control his own
mind, and with this control, obviously, every person may open his mind to the
tramp thought impulses which are being released by other brains, or close the
doors tightly and admit only thought impulses of his own choice.
Nature has endowed man with absolute control over but one thing, and
that is THOUGHT. This fact, coupled with the additional fact that everything
which man creates, begins in the form of a thought, leads one very near to the
principle by which FEAR may be mastered.
If it is true that ALL THOUGHT HAS A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE
ITSELF IN ITS PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT (and this is true, beyond any
reasonable room for doubt), it is equally true that thought impulses of fear and
poverty cannot be translated into terms of courage and financial gain.
The people of America began to think of poverty, following the Wall
Street crash of 1929. Slowly, but surely that mass thought was crystalized into its
physical equivalent, which was known as a "depression." This had to happen, it
is in conformity with the laws of Nature.

THE FEAR OF POVERTY
There can be no compromise between POVERTY and RICHES! The two
roads that lead to poverty and riches travel in opposite directions. If you want
riches, you must refuse to accept any circumstance that leads toward poverty.
(The word "riches" is here used in its broadest sense, meaning financial, spiritual,
mental and material estates). The starting point of the path that leads to riches is
DESIRE. In chapter one, you received full instructions for the proper use of
DESIRE. In this chapter, on FEAR, you have complete instructions for preparing
your mind to make practical use of DESIRE.
Here, then, is the place to give yourself a challenge which will definitely
determine how much of this philosophy you have absorbed. Here is the point at
which you can turn prophet and foretell, accurately, what the future holds in
store for you. If, after reading this chapter, you are willing to accept poverty, you

may as well make up your mind to receive poverty. This is one decision you
cannot avoid.
If you demand riches, determine what form, and how much will be
required to satisfy you. You know the road that leads to riches. You have been
given a road map which, if followed, will keep you on that road. If you neglect to
make the start, or stop before you arrive, no one will be to blame, but YOU. This
responsibility is yours. No alibi will save you from accepting the responsibility if
you now fail or refuse to demand riches of Life, because the acceptance calls for
but one thing— incidentally, the only thing you can control—and that is a STATE
OF MIND. A state of mind is something that one assumes. It cannot be
purchased, it must be created.
Fear of poverty is a state of mind, nothing else! But it is sufficient to
destroy one's chances of achievement in any undertaking, a truth which became
painfully evident during the depression.
This fear paralyzes the faculty of reason, destroys the faculty of
imagination, kills off self-reliance, undermines enthusiasm, discourages
initiative, leads to uncertainty of purpose, encourages procrastination, wipes out
enthusiasm and makes self-control an impossibility. It takes the charm from one's
personality, destroys the possibility of accurate thinking, diverts concentration of
effort, it masters persistence, turns the will-power into nothingness, destroys
ambition, beclouds the memory and invites failure in every conceivable form; it
kills love and assassinates the finer emotions of the heart, discourages friendship
and invites disaster in a hundred forms, leads to sleeplessness, misery and
unhappiness— and all this despite the obvious truth that we live in a world of
over-abundance of everything the heart could desire, with nothing standing
between us and our desires, excepting lack of a definite purpose.
The Fear of Poverty is, without doubt, the most destructive of the six basic
fears. It has been placed at the head of the list, because it is the most difficult to
master. Considerable courage is required to state the truth about the origin of
this fear, and still greater courage to accept the truth after it has been stated. The
fear of poverty grew out of man's inherited tendency to PREY UPON HIS
FELLOW MAN ECONOMICALLY. Nearly all animals lower than man are
motivated by instinct, but their capacity to "think" is limited, therefore, they prey
upon one another physically. Man, with his superior sense of intuition, with the
capacity to think and to reason, does not eat his fellowman bodily, he gets more
satisfaction out of "eating" him FINANCIALLY. Man is so avaricious that every
conceivable law has been passed to safeguard him from his fellowman.

Of all the ages of the world, of which we know anything, the age in which
we live seems to be one that is outstanding because of man's money-madness. A
man is considered less than the dust of the earth, unless he can display a fat bank
account; but if he has money— NEVER MIND HOW HE ACQUIRED IT— he is a
"king" or a "big shot"; he is above the law, he rules in politics, he dominates in
business, and the whole world about him bows in respect when he passes.
Nothing brings man so much suffering and humility as POVERTY! Only
those who have experienced poverty understand the full meaning of this.
It is no wonder that man fears poverty. Through a long line of inherited
experiences man has learned, for sure, that some men cannot be trusted, where
matters of money and earthly possessions are concerned. This is a rather stinging
indictment, the worst part of it being that it is TRUE.
The majority of marriages are motivated by the wealth possessed by one,
or both of the contracting parties. It is no wonder, therefore, that the divorce
courts are busy.
So eager is man to possess wealth that he will acquire it in whatever
manner he can— through legal methods if possible— through other methods if
necessary or expedient.
Self-analysis may disclose weaknesses which one does not like to
acknowledge. This form of examination is essential to all who demand of Life
more than mediocrity and poverty. Remember, as you check yourself point by
point, that you are both the court and the jury, the prosecuting attorney and the
attorney for the defense, and that you are the plaintiff and the defendant, also,
that you are on trial. Face the facts squarely. Ask yourself definite questions and
demand direct replies. When the examination is over, you will know more about
yourself. If you do not feel that you can be an impartial judge in this selfexamination, call upon someone who knows you well to serve as judge while
you cross-examine yourself. You are after the truth. Get it, no matter at what cost
even though it may temporarily embarrass you!
The majority of people, if asked what they fear most, would reply, "I fear
nothing." The reply would be inaccurate, because few people realize that they are
bound, handicapped, whipped spiritually and physically through some form of
fear. So subtle and deeply seated is the emotion of fear that one may go through
life burdened with it, never recognizing its presence. Only a courageous analysis
will disclose the presence of this universal enemy. When you begin such an
analysis, search deeply into your character. Here is a list of the symptoms for
which you should look:

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF POVERTY
INDIFFERENCE. Commonly expressed through lack of ambition; willingness to
tolerate poverty; acceptance of whatever compensation life may offer without
protest; mental and physical laziness; lack of initiative, imagination, enthusiasm
and self-control
INDECISION. The habit of permitting others to do one's thinking. Staying "on
the fence."
DOUBT. Generally expressed through alibis and excuses designed to cover up,
explain away, or apologize for one's failures, sometimes expressed in the form of
envy of those who are successful, or by criticising them.
WORRY. Usually expressed by finding fault with others, a tendency to spend
beyond one's income, neglect of personal appearance, scowling and frowning;
intemperance in the use of alcoholic drink, sometimes through the use of
narcotics; nervousness, lack of poise, self-consciousness and lack of self-reliance.
OVER-CAUTION. The habit of looking for the negative side of every
circumstance, thinking and talking of possible failure instead of concentrating
upon the means of succeeding. Knowing all the roads to disaster, but never
searching for the plans to avoid failure. Waiting for "the right time" to begin
putting ideas and plans into action, until the waiting becomes a permanent habit.
Remembering those who have failed, and forgetting those who have succeeded.
Seeing the hole in the doughnut, but overlooking the doughnut. Pessimism,
leading to indigestion, poor elimination, auto-intoxication, bad breath and bad
disposition.
PROCRASTINATION. The habit of putting off until tomorrow that which should
have been done last year. Spending enough time in creating alibis and excuses to
have done the job. This symptom is closely related to over-caution, doubt and
worry. Refusal to accept responsibility when it can be avoided. Willingness to
compromise rather than put up a stiff fight. Compromising with difficulties
instead of harnessing and using them as stepping stones to advancement.
Bargaining with Life for a penny, instead of demanding prosperity, opulence,
riches, contentment and happiness. Planning what to do IF AND WHEN

OVERTAKEN BY FAILURE, INSTEAD OF BURNING ALL BRIDGES AND
MAKING RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE. Weakness of, and often total lack of selfconfidence, definiteness of purpose, self-control, initiative, enthusiasm, ambition,
thrift and sound reasoning ability. EXPECTING POVERTY INSTEAD OF
DEMANDING RICHES. Association with those who accept poverty instead of
seeking the company of those who demand and receive riches.
MONEY TALKS!
Some will ask, "why did you write a book about money? Why measure
riches in dollars, alone?" Some will believe, and rightly so, that there are other
forms of riches more desirable than money. Yes, there are riches which cannot be
measured in terms of dollars, but there are millions of people who will say, "Give
me all the money I need, and I will find everything else I want."
The major reason why I wrote this book on how to get money is the fact
that the world has but lately passed through an experience that left millions of
men and women paralyzed with the FEAR OF POVERTY. What this sort of fear
does to one was well described by Westbrook Pegler, in the New York WorldTelegram, viz:
"Money is only clam shells or metal discs or scraps of paper, and there are
treasures of the heart and soul which money cannot buy, but most people, being
broke, are unable to keep this in mind and sustain their spirits. When a man is
down and out and on the street, unable to get any job at all, something happens
to his spirit which can be observed in the droop of his shoulders, the set of his
hat, his walk and his gaze. He cannot escape a feeling of inferiority among
people with regular employment, even though he knows they are definitely not
his equals in character, intelligence or ability.
"These people—even his friends—feel, on the other hand, a sense of
superiority and regard him, perhaps unconsciously, as a casualty. He may
borrow for a time, but not enough to carry on in his accustomed way, and he
cannot continue to borrow very long. But borrowing in itself, when a man is
borrowing merely to live, is a depressing experience, and the money lacks the
power of earned money to revive his spirits. Of course, none of this applies to
bums or habitual ne'er-do-wells, but only to men of normal ambitions and selfrespect.
"WOMEN CONCEAL DESPAIR.

"Women in the same predicament must be different. We somehow do not
think of women at all in considering the down-and-outers. They are scarce in the
breadlines, they rarely are seen begging on the streets, and they are not
recognizable in crowds by the same plain signs which identify busted men. Of
course, I do not mean the shuffling hags of the city streets who are the opposite
number of the confirmed male bums. I mean reasonably young, decent and
intelligent women. There must be many of them, but their despair is not
apparent. Maybe they kill themselves.
"When a man is down and out he has time on his hands for brooding. He
may travel miles to see a man about a job and discover that the job is filled or
that it is one of those jobs with no base pay but only a commission on the sale of
some useless knick-knack which nobody would buy, except out of pity. Turning
that down, he finds himself back on the street with nowhere to go but just
anywhere. So he walks and walks. He gazes into store windows at luxuries
which are not for him, and feels inferior and gives way to people who stop to
look with an active interest. He wanders into the railroad station or puts himself
down in the library to ease his legs and soak up a little heat, but that isn't looking
for a job, so he gets going again. He may not know it, but his aimlessness would
give him away even if the very lines of his figure did not. He may be well
dressed in the clothes left over from the days when he had a steady job, but the
clothes cannot disguise the droop.
"MONEY MAKES DIFFERENCE.
"He sees thousands of other people, bookkeepers or clerks or chemists or
wagon hands, busy at their work and envies them from the bottom of his soul.
They have their independence, their self-respect and manhood, and he simply
cannot convince himself that he is a good man, too, though he argue it out and
arrive at a favorable verdict hour after hour.
"It is just money which makes this difference in him. With a little money
he would be himself again.
"Some employers take the most shocking advantage of people who are
down and out. The agencies hang out little colored cards offering miserable
wages to busted men—$ 12 a week, $15 a week. An $18 a week job is a plum, and
anyone with $25 a week to offer does not hang the job in front of an agency on a
colored card. I have a want ad clipped from a local paper demanding a clerk, a

good, clean penman, to take telephone orders for a sandwich shop from 11 A. M.
to 2 P. M. for $8 a month— not $8 a week but $8 a month. The ad says also, 'State
religion. ' Can you imagine the brutal effrontery of anyone who demands a good,
clean penman for 11 cents an hour inquiring into the victim's religion? But that is
what busted people are offered."
THE FEAR OF CRITICISM
Just how man originally came by this fear, no one can state definitely, but
one thing is certain— he has it in a highly developed form. Some believe that this
fear made its appearance about the time that politics became a "profession."
Others believe it can be traced to the age when women first began to concern
themselves with "styles" in wearing apparel.
This author, being neither a humorist nor a prophet, is inclined to attribute
the basic fear of criticism to that part of man's inherited nature which prompts
him not only to take away his fellowman's goods and wares, but to justify his
action by CRITICISM of his fellowman's character. It is a well known fact that a
thief will criticise the man from whom he steals—that politicians seek office, not
by displaying their own virtues and qualifications, but by attempting to besmirch
their opponents.
The fear of criticism takes on many forms, the majority of which are petty
and trivial. Bald-headed men, for example, are bald for no other reason than their
fear of criticism. Heads become bald because of the tight fitting bands of hats
which cut off the circulation from the roots of the hair. Men wear hats, not
because they actually need them, but mainly because "everyone is doing it." The
individual falls into line and does likewise, lest some other individual CRITICISE
him. Women seldom have bald heads, or even thin hair, because they wear hats
which fit their heads loosely, the only purpose of the hats being adornment.
But, it must not be supposed that women are free from the fear of
criticism. If any woman claims to be superior to man with reference to this fear,
ask her to walk down the street wearing a hat of the vintage of 1890.
The astute manufacturers of clothing have not been slow to capitalize this
basic fear of criticism, with which all mankind has been cursed. Every season the
styles in many articles of wearing apparel change. Who establishes the styles?
Certainly not the purchaser of clothing, but the manufacturer. Why does he
change the styles so often? The answer is obvious. He changes the styles so he
can sell more clothes.

For the same reason the manufacturers of automobiles (with a few rare
and very sensible exceptions) change styles of models every season. No man
wants to drive an automobile which is not of the latest style, although the older
model may actually be the better car.
We have been describing the manner in which people behave under the
influence of fear of criticism as applied to the small and petty things of life. Let us
now examine human behavior when this fear affects people in connection with
the more important events of human relationship. Take for example practically
any person who has reached the age of "mental maturity" (from 35 to 40 years of
age, as a general average), and if you could read the secret thoughts of his mind,
you would find a very decided disbelief in most of the fables taught by the
majority of the dogmatists and theologians a few decades back.
Not often, however, will you find a person who has the courage to openly
state his belief on this subject. Most people will, if pressed far enough, tell a lie
rather than admit that they do not believe the stories associated with that form of
religion which held people in bondage prior to the age of scientific discovery and
education.
Why does the average person, even in this day of enlightenment, shy
away from denying his belief in the fables which were the basis of most of the
religions a few decades ago? The answer is, "because of the fear of criticism."
Men and women have been burned at the stake for daring to express disbelief in
ghosts. It is no wonder we have inherited a consciousness which makes us fear
criticism. The time was, and not so far in the past, when criticism carried severe
punishments—it still does in some countries.
The fear of criticism robs man of his initiative, destroys his power of
imagination, limits his individuality, takes away his self-reliance, and does him
damage in a hundred other ways. Parents often do their children irreparable
injury by criticising them. The mother of one of my boyhood chums used to
punish him with a switch almost daily, always completing the job with the
statement, "You'll land in the penitentiary before you are twenty." He was sent to
a Reformatory at the age of seventeen.
Criticism is the one form of service, of which everyone has too much.
Everyone has a stock of it which is handed out, gratis, whether called for or not.
One's nearest relatives often are the worst offenders. It should be recognized as a
crime (in reality it is a crime of the worst nature), for any parent to build
inferiority complexes in the mind of a child, through unnecessary criticism.
Employers who understand human nature, get the best there is in men, not by

criticism, but by constructive suggestion. Parents may accomplish the same
results with their children. Criticism will plant FEAR in the human heart, or
resentment, but it will not build love or affection.

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF CRITICISM
This fear is almost as universal as the fear of poverty, and its effects are
just as fatal to personal achievement, mainly because this fear destroys initiative,
and discourages the use of imagination. The major symptoms of the fear are:
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS. Generally expressed through
nervousness, timidity in conversation and in meeting strangers,
awkward movement of the hands and limbs, shifting of the eyes.
LACK OF POISE. Expressed through lack of voice control,
nervousness in the presence of others, poor posture of body, poor
memory.
PERSONALITY. Lacking in firmness of decision, personal
charm, and ability to express opinions definitely. The habit of sidestepping issues instead of meeting them squarely. Agreeing with
others without careful examination of their opinions.
INFERIORITY COMPLEX. The habit of expressing selfapproval by word of mouth and by actions, as a means of covering
up a feeling of inferiority. Using "big words" to impress others,
(often without knowing the real meaning of the words). Imitating
others in dress, speech and manners. Boasting of imaginary
achievements. This sometimes gives a surface appearance of a
feeling of superiority.
EXTRAVAGANCE. The habit of trying to "keep up with the
Joneses," spending beyond one's income.
LACK OF INITIATIVE. Failure to embrace opportunities for
self-advancement, fear to express opinions, lack of confidence in
one's own ideas, giving evasive answers to questions asked by
superiors, hesitancy of manner and speech, deceit in both words
and deeds.
LACK OF AMBITION. Mental and physical laziness, lack of
self-assertion, slowness in reaching decisions, easily influenced by
others, the habit of criticising others behind their backs and

flattering them to their faces, the habit of accepting defeat without
protest, quitting an undertaking when opposed by others,
suspicious of other people without cause, lacking in tactfulness of
manner and speech, unwillingness to accept the blame for mistakes.

THE FEAR OF ILL HEALTH
This fear may be traced to both physical and social heredity. It is closely
associated, as to its origin, with the causes of fear of Old Age and the fear of
Death, because it leads one closely to the border of "terrible worlds" of which
man knows not, but concerning which he has been taught some discomforting
stories. The opinion is somewhat general, also, that certain unethical people
engaged in the business of "selling health" have had not a little to do with
keeping alive the fear of ill health.
In the main, man fears ill health because of the terrible pictures which
have been planted in his mind of what may happen if death should overtake
him. He also fears it because of the economic toll which it may claim.
A reputable physician estimated that 75% of all people who visit
physicians for professional service are suffering with hypochondria (imaginary
illness). It has been shown most convincingly that the fear of disease, even where
there is not the slightest cause for fear, often produces the physical symptoms of
the disease feared.
Powerful and mighty is the human mind! It builds or it destroys.
Playing upon this common weakness of fear of ill health, dispensers of
patent medicines have reaped fortunes. This form of imposition upon credulous
humanity became so prevalent some twenty years ago that Colliers' Weekly
Magazine conducted a bitter campaign against some of the worst offenders in the
patent medicine business.
During the "flu" epidemic which broke out during the world war, the
mayor of New York City took drastic steps to check the damage which people
were doing themselves through their inherent fear of ill health. He called in the
newspaper men and said to them, "Gentlemen, I feel it necessary to ask you not
to publish any scare headlines concerning the 'flu' epidemic. Unless you cooperate
with me, we will have a situation which we cannot control." The newspapers quit
publishing stories about the "flu," and within one month the epidemic had been
successfully checked.
Through a series of experiments conducted some years ago, it was proved
that people may be made ill by suggestion. We conducted this experiment by

causing three acquaintances to visit the "victims," each of whom asked the
question, "What ails you? You look terribly ill." The first questioner usually
provoked a grin, and a nonchalant "Oh, nothing, I'm alright," from the victim.
The second questioner usually was answered with the statement, "I don't know
exactly, but I do feel badly." The third questioner was usually met with the frank
admission that the victim was actually feeling ill.
Try this on an acquaintance if you doubt that it will make him
uncomfortable, but do not carry the experiment too far. There is a certain
religious sect whose members take vengeance upon their enemies by the
"hexing" method. They call it "placing a spell" on the victim.
There is overwhelming evidence that disease sometimes begins in the
form of negative thought impulse. Such an impulse may be passed from one
mind to another, by suggestion, or created by an individual in his own mind.
A man who was blessed with more wisdom than this incident might
indicate, once said "When anyone asks me how I feel, I always want to answer by
knocking him down."
Doctors send patients into new climates for their health, because a change
of "mental attitude" is necessary. The seed of fear of ill health lives in every
human mind. Worry, fear, discouragement, disappointment in love and business
affairs, cause this seed to germinate and grow. The recent business depression
kept the doctors on the run, because every form of negative thinking may cause
ill health.
Disappointments in business and in love stand at the head of the list of
causes of fear of ill health. A young man suffered a disappointment in love which
sent him to a hospital. For months he hovered between life and death. A
specialist in suggestive therapeutics was called in. The specialist changed nurses,
placing him in charge of a very charming young woman who began (by prearrangement with the doctor) to make love to him the first day of her arrival on
the job. Within three weeks the patient was discharged from the hospital, still
suffering, but with an entirely different malady. HE WAS IN LOVE AGAIN. The
remedy was a hoax, but the patient and the nurse were later married. Both are in
good health at the time of this writing.

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF ILL HEALTH
The symptoms of this almost universal fear are:

AUTO-SUGGESTION. The habit of negative use of selfsuggestion by looking for, and expecting to find the symptoms of
all kinds of disease. "Enjoying" imaginary illness and speaking of it
as being real. The habit of trying all "fads" and "isms"
recommended by others as having therapeutic value. Talking to
others of operations, accidents and other forms of illness.
Experimenting with diets, physical exercises, reducing systems,
without professional guidance. Trying home remedies, patent
medicines and "quack" remedies.
HYPOCHONDRIA. The habit of talking of illness,
concentrating the mind upon disease, and expecting its appearance
until a nervous break occurs. Nothing that comes in bottles can cure
this condition. It is brought on by negative thinking and nothing
but positive thought can affect a cure. Hypochondria, (a medical
term for imaginary disease) is said to do as much damage on
occasion, as the disease one fears might do. Most so-called cases of
"nerves" come from imaginary illness.
EXERCISE. Fear of ill health often interferes with proper
physical exercise, and results in over-weight, by causing one to
avoid outdoor life.
SUSCEPTIBILITY. Fear of ill health breaks down Nature's
body resistance, and creates a favorable condition for any form of
disease one may contact.
The fear of ill health often is related to the fear of Poverty,
especially in the case of the hypochondriac, who constantly worries
about the possibility of having to pay doctor's bills, hospital bills,
etc. This type of person spends much time preparing for sickness,
talking about death, saving money for cemetery lots, and burial
expenses, etc.
SELF-CODDLING. The habit of making a bid for sympathy,
using imaginary illness as the lure. (People often resort to this trick
to avoid work). The habit of feigning illness to cover plain laziness,
or to serve as an alibi for lack of ambition.
INTEMPERANCE. The habit of using alcohol or narcotics to
destroy pains such as headaches, neuralgia, etc., instead of
eliminating the cause.


The habit of reading about illness and worrying over the
possibility of being stricken by it. The habit of reading patent
medicine advertisements.

THE FEAR OF LOSS OF LOVE
The original source of this inherent fear needs but little description,
because it obviously grew out of man's polygamous habit of stealing his fellowman's mate, and his habit of taking liberties with her whenever he could.
Jealousy, and other similar forms of dementia praecox grow out of man's
inherited fear of the loss of love of someone. This fear is the most painful of all
the six basic fears. It probably plays more havoc with the body and mind than
any of the other basic fears, as it often leads to permanent insanity.
The fear of the loss of love probably dates back to the stone age, when
men stole women by brute force. They continue to steal females, but their
technique has changed. Instead of force, they now use persuasion, the promise of
pretty clothes, motor cars, and other "bait" much more effective than physical
force. Man's habits are the same as they were at the dawn of civilization, but he
expresses them differently.
Careful analysis has shown that women are more susceptible to this fear
than men. This fact is easily explained. Women have learned, from experience,
that men are polygamous by nature, that they are not to be trusted in the hands
of rivals.

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF LOSS OF LOVE
The distinguishing symptoms of this fear are:—
JEALOUSY. The habit of being suspicious of friends and
loved ones without any reasonable evidence of sufficient grounds.
(Jealousy is a form of dementia praecox which sometimes becomes
violent without the slightest cause). The habit of accusing wife or
husband of infidelity without grounds. General suspicion of
everyone, absolute faith in no one.
FAULT FINDING. The habit of finding fault with friends,
relatives, business associates and loved ones upon the slightest
provocation, or without any cause whatsoever.

GAMBLING. The habit of gambling, stealing, cheating, and
otherwise taking hazardous chances to provide money for loved
ones, with the belief that love can be bought. The habit of spending
beyond one's means, or incurring debts, to provide gifts for loved
ones, with the object of making a favorable showing. Insomnia,
nervousness, lack of persistence, weakness of will, lack of selfcontrol, lack of self-reliance, bad temper.

THE FEAR OF OLD AGE
In the main, this fear grows out of two sources. First, the thought that old
age may bring with it POVERTY. Secondly, and by far the most common source
of origin, from false and cruel teachings of the past which have been too well
mixed with "fire and brimstone," and other bogies cunningly designed to enslave
man through fear.
In the basic fear of old age, man has two very sound reasons for his
apprehension— one growing out of his distrust of his fellowman, who may seize
whatever worldly goods he may possess, and the other arising from the terrible
pictures of the world beyond, which were planted in his mind, through social
heredity before he came into full possession of his mind.
The possibility of ill health, which is more common as people grow older,
is also a contributing cause of this common fear of old age. Eroticism also enters
into the cause of the fear of old age, as no man cherishes the thought of
diminishing sex attraction.
The most common cause of fear of old age is associated with the
possibility of poverty. "Poorhouse" is not a pretty word. It throws a chill into the
mind of every person who faces the possibility of having to spend his declining
years on a poor farm.
Another contributing cause of the fear of old age, is the possibility of loss
of freedom and independence, as old age may bring with it the loss of both
physical and economic freedom.

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF OLD AGE
The commonest symptoms of this fear are:
The tendency to slow down and develop an inferiority
complex at the age of mental maturity, around the age of forty,

falsely believing one's self to be "slipping" because of age. (The
truth is that man's most useful years, mentally and spiritually, are
those between forty and sixty).
The habit of speaking apologetically of one's self as "being
old" merely because one has reached the age of forty, or fifty,
instead of reversing the rule and expressing gratitude for having
reached the age of wisdom and understanding.
The habit of killing off initiative, imagination, and selfreliance by falsely believing one's self too old to exercise these
qualities. The habit of the man or woman of forty dressing with the
aim of trying to appear much younger, and affecting mannerisms
of youth; thereby inspiring ridicule by both friends and strangers.

THE FEAR OF DEATH
To some this is the cruelest of all the basic fears. The reason is obvious.
The terrible pangs of fear associated with the thought of death, in the majority of
cases, may be charged directly to religious fanaticism. So-called "heathen" are
less afraid of death than the more "civilized." For hundreds of millions of years
man has been asking the still unanswered questions, "whence" and "whither."
Where did I come from, and where am I going?
During the darker ages of the past, the more cunning and crafty were not
slow to offer the answer to these questions, FOR A PRICE. Witness, now, the
major source of origin of the FEAR OF DEATH.
"Come into my tent, embrace my faith, accept my dogmas, and I will give
you a ticket that will admit you straightaway into heaven when you die," cries a
leader of sectarianism. "Remain out of my tent," says the same leader, "and may
the devil take you and burn you throughout eternity."
ETERNITY is a long time. FIRE is a terrible thing. The thought of eternal
punishment, with fire, not only causes man to fear death, it often causes him to
lose his reason. It destroys interest in life and makes happiness impossible.
During my research, I reviewed a book entitled "A Catalogue of the
Gods," in which were listed the 30,000 gods which man has worshiped. Think of
it! Thirty thousand of them, represented by everything from a crawfish to a man.
It is little wonder that men have become frightened at the approach of death.
While the religious leader may not be able to provide safe conduct into
heaven, nor, by lack of such provision, allow the unfortunate to descend into
hell, the possibility of the latter seems so terrible that the very thought of it lays

hold of the imagination in such a realistic way that it paralyzes reason, and sets
up the fear of death.
In truth, NO MAN KNOWS, and no man has ever known, what heaven or
hell is like, nor does any man know if either place actually exists. This very lack
of positive knowledge opens the door of the human mind to the charlatan so he
may enter and control that mind with his stock of legerdemain and various
brands of pious fraud and trickery.
The fear of DEATH is not as common now as it was during the age when
there were no great colleges and universities. Men of science have turned the
spotlight of truth upon the world, and this truth is rapidly freeing men and
women from this terrible fear of DEATH. The young men and young women
who attend the colleges and universities are not easily impressed by "fire" and
"brimstone." Through the aid of biology, astronomy, geology, and other related
sciences, the fears of the dark ages which gripped the minds of men and
destroyed their reason have been dispelled.
Insane asylums are filled with men and women who have gone mad,
because of the FEAR OF DEATH.
This fear is useless. Death will come, no matter what anyone may think
about it. Accept it as a necessity, and pass the thought out of your mind. It must
be a, necessity, or it would not come to all. Perhaps it is not as bad as it has been
pictured.
The entire world is made up of only two things, ENERGY and MATTER.
In elementary physics we learn that neither matter nor energy (the only two
realities known to man) can be created nor destroyed. Both matter and energy
can be transformed, but neither can be destroyed.
Life is energy, if it is anything. If neither energy nor matter can be
destroyed, of course life cannot be destroyed. Life, like other forms of energy,
may be passed through various processes of transition, or change, but it cannot
be destroyed. Death is mere transition.
If death is not mere change, or transition, then nothing comes after death
except a long, eternal, peaceful sleep, and sleep is nothing to be feared. Thus you
may wipe out, forever, the fear of Death.

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF DEATH
The general symptoms of this fear are:—
The habit of THINKING about dying instead of making the
most of LIFE, due, generally, to lack of purpose, or lack of a suitable

occupation. This fear is more prevalent among the aged, but
sometimes the more youthful are victims of it. The greatest of all
remedies for the fear of death is a BURNING DESIRE FOR
ACHIEVEMENT, backed by useful service to others. A busy person
seldom has time to think about dying. He finds life too thrilling to
worry about death. Sometimes the fear of death is closely
associated with the Fear of Poverty, where one's death would leave
loved ones poverty-stricken. In other cases, the fear of death is
caused by illness and the consequent breaking down of physical
body resistance. The commonest causes of the fear of death are: illhealth, poverty, lack of appropriate occupation, disappointment
over love, insanity, religious fanaticism.

OLD MAN WORRY
Worry is a state of mind based upon fear. It works slowly, but
persistently. It is insiduous and subtle. Step by step it "digs itself in" until it
paralyzes one's reasoning faculty, destroys self-confidence and initiative. Worry
is a form of sustained fear caused by indecision therefore it is a state of mind
which can be controlled.
An unsettled mind is helpless. Indecision makes an unsettled mind. Most
individuals lack the willpower to reach decisions promptly, and to stand by them
after they have been made, even during normal business conditions. During
periods of economic unrest (such as the world recently experienced), the
individual is handicapped, not alone by his inherent nature to be slow at
reaching decisions, but he is influenced by the indecision of others around him
who have created a state of "mass indecision."
During the depression the whole atmosphere, all over the world, was
filled with "Fearenza" and "Worryitis," the two mental disease germs which
began to spread themselves after the Wall Street frenzy in 1929. There is only one
known antidote for these germs; it is the habit of prompt and firm DECISION.
Moreover, it is an antidote which every individual must apply for himself.
We do not worry over conditions, once we have reached a decision to
follow a definite line of action.
I once interviewed a man who was to be electrocuted two hours later. The
condemned man was the calmest of some eight men who were in the death-cell

with him. His calmness prompted me to ask him how it felt to know that he was
going into eternity in a short while. With a smile of confidence on his face, he
said, "It feels fine. Just think, brother, my troubles will soon be over. I have had
nothing but trouble all my life. It has been a hardship to get food and clothing.
Soon I will not need these things. I have felt fine ever since I learned FOR
CERTAIN that I must die. I made up my mind then, to accept my fate in good
spirit."
As he spoke he devoured a dinner of proportions sufficient for three men,
eating every mouthful of the food brought to him, and apparently enjoying it as
much as if no disaster awaited him. DECISION gave this man resignation to his
fate! Decision can also prevent one's acceptance of undesired circumstances.
The six basic fears become translated into a state of worry, through
indecision. Relieve yourself, forever of the fear of death, by reaching a decision to
accept death as an inescapable event. Whip the fear of poverty by reaching a
decision to get along with whatever wealth you can accumulate WITHOUT
WORRY. Put your foot upon the neck of the fear of criticism by reaching a
decision NOT TO WORRY about what other people think, do, or say. Eliminate
the fear of old age by reaching a decision to accept it, not as a handicap, but as a
great blessing which carries with it wisdom, self-control, and understanding not
known to youth.
Acquit yourself of the fear of ill health by the decision to forget symptoms.
Master the fear of loss of love by reaching a decision to get along without love, if
that is necessary.
Kill the habit of worry, in all its forms, by reaching a general, blanket
decision that nothing which life has to offer is worth the price of worry. With this
decision will come poise, peace of mind, and calmness of thought which will
bring happiness.
A man whose mind is filled with fear not only destroys his own chances of
intelligent action, but, he transmits these destructive vibrations to the minds of
all who come into contact with him, and destroys, also their chances.
Even a dog or a horse knows when its master lacks courage; moreover, a
dog or a horse will pick up the vibrations of fear thrown off by its master, and
behave accordingly. Lower down the line of intelligence in the animal kingdom,
one finds this same capacity to pick up the vibrations of fear. A honey-bee
immediately senses fear in the mind of a person—for reasons unknown, a bee
will sting the person whose mind is releasing vibrations of fear, much more
readily than it will molest the person whose mind registers no fear.

The vibrations of fear pass from one mind to another just as quickly and as
surely as the sound of the human voice passes from the broadcasting station to
the receiving set of a radio—and BY THE SELF-SAME MEDIUM.
Mental telepathy is a reality. Thoughts pass from one mind to another,
voluntarily, whether or not this fact is recognized by either the person releasing
the thoughts, or the persons who pick up those thoughts.
The person who gives expression, by word of mouth, to negative or
destructive thoughts is practically certain to experience the results of those words
in the form of a destructive "kick-back." The release of destructive thought
impulses, alone, without the aid of words, produces also a "kickback" in more
ways than one. First of all, and perhaps most important to be remembered, the
person who releases thoughts of a destructive nature, must suffer damage
through the breaking down of the faculty of creative imagination. Secondly, the
presence in the mind of any destructive emotion develops a negative personality
which repels people, and often converts them into antagonists. The third source
of damage to the person who entertains or releases negative thoughts, lies in this
significant fact— these thought-impulses are not only damaging to others, but
they IMBED THEMSELVES IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OF THE PERSON
RELEASING THEM, and there become a part of his character.
One is never through with a thought, merely by releasing it. When a
thought is released, it spreads in every direction, through the medium of the
ether, but it also plants itself permanently in the subconscious mind of the person
releasing it.
Your business in life is, presumably to achieve success. To be successful,
you must find peace of mind, acquire the material needs of life, and above all,
attain HAPPINESS. All of these evidences of success begin in the form of thought
impulses.
You may control your own mind, you have the power to feed it whatever
thought impulses you choose. With this privilege goes also the responsibility of
using it constructively. You are the master of your own earthly destiny just as
surely as you have the power to control your own thoughts. You may influence,
direct, and eventually control your own environment, making your life what you
want it to be— or, you may neglect to exercise the privilege which is yours, to
make your life to order, thus casting yourself upon the broad sea of
"Circumstance" where you will be tossed hither and yon, like a chip on the waves
of the ocean.


THE DEVIL'S WORKSHOP
THE SEVENTH BASIC EVIL
In addition to the Six Basic Fears, there is another evil by which people
suffer. It constitutes a rich soil in which the seeds of failure grow abundantly. It is
so subtle that its presence often is not detected. This affliction cannot properly be
classed as a fear. IT IS MORE DEEPLY SEATED AND MORE OFTEN FATAL
THAN ALL OF THE SIX FEARS. For want of a better name, let us call this evil
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEGATIVE INFLUENCES.
Men who accumulate great riches always protect themselves against this
evil! The poverty stricken never do! Those who succeed in any calling must
prepare their minds to resist the evil. If you are reading this philosophy for the
purpose of accumulating riches, you should examine yourself very carefully, to
determine whether you are susceptible to negative influences. If you neglect this
self-analysis, you will forfeit your right to attain the object of your desires.
Make the analysis searching. After you read the questions prepared for
this self-analysis, hold yourself to a strict accounting in your answers. Go at the
task as carefully as you would search for any other enemy you knew to be
awaiting you in ambush and deal with your own faults as you would with a
more tangible enemy.
You can easily protect yourself against highway robbers, because the law
provides organized cooperation for your benefit, but the "seventh basic evil" is
more difficult to master, because it strikes when you are not aware of its
presence, when you are asleep, and while you are awake. Moreover, its weapon
is intangible, because it consists of merely— a STATE OF MIND. This evil is also
dangerous because it strikes in as many different forms as there are human
experiences. Sometimes it enters the mind through the well-meant words of one's
own relatives. At other times, it bores from within, through one's own mental
attitude. Always it is as deadly as poison, even though it may not kill as quickly.

How TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST NEGATIVE
INFLUENCES
To protect yourself against negative influences, whether of your own
making, or the result of the activities of negative people around you, recognize

that you have a WILL-POWER, and put it into constant use, until it builds a wall
of immunity against negative influences in your own mind.
Recognize the fact that you, and every other human being, are, by nature,
lazy, indifferent, and susceptible to all suggestions which harmonize with your
weaknesses.
Recognize that you are, by nature, susceptible to all the six basic fears, and
set up. habits for the purpose of counteracting all these fears.
Recognize that negative influences often work on you through your
subconscious mind, therefore they are difficult to detect, and keep your mind
closed against all people who depress or discourage you in any way.
Clean out your medicine chest, throw away all pill bottles, and stop
pandering to colds, aches, pains and imaginary illness.
Deliberately seek the company of people who influence you to THINK
AND ACT FOR YOURSELF.
Do not EXPECT troubles as they have a tendency not to dissappoint.
Without doubt, the most common weakness of all human beings is the habit of
leaving their minds open to the negative influence of other people. This weakness is all
the more damaging, because most people do not recognize that they are cursed
by it, and many who acknowledge it, neglect or refuse to correct the evil until it
becomes an uncontrollable part of their daily habits.
To aid those who wish to see themselves as they really are, the following
list of questions has been prepared. Read the questions and state your answers
aloud, so you can hear your own voice. This will make it easier for you to be
truthful with yourself.

How much time have you devoted to studying and
answering these questions? (At least one day is necessary for the
analysis and the answering of the entire list.)
If you have answered all these questions truthfully, you know more about
yourself than the majority of people. Study the questions carefully, come back to
them once each week for several months, and be astounded at the amount of
additional knowledge of great value to yourself, you will have gained by the
simple method of answering the questions truthfully. If you are not certain
concerning the answers to some of the questions, seek the counsel of those who
know you well, especially those who have no motive in flattering you, and see
yourself through their eyes. The experience will be astonishing.
You have ABSOLUTE CONTROL over but one thing, and that is your
thoughts. This is the most significant and inspiring of all facts known to man! It
reflects man's Divine nature. This Divine prerogative is the sole means by which
you may control your own destiny. If you fail to control your own mind, you
may be sure you will control nothing else.
If you must be careless with your possessions, let it be in connection with
material things. Your mind is your spiritual estate! Protect and use it with the care
to which Divine Royalty is entitled. You were given a WILL-POWER for this
purpose.
Unfortunately, there is no legal protection against those who, either by
design or ignorance, poison the minds of others by negative suggestion. This
form of destruction should be punishable by heavy legal penalties, because it
may and often does destroy one's chances of acquiring material things which are
protected by law.
Men with negative minds tried to convince Thomas A. Edison that he
could not build a machine that would record and reproduce the human voice,
"because" they said, "no one else had ever produced such a machine." Edison did

not believe them. He knew that the mind could produce ANYTHING THE
MIND COULD CONCEIVE AND BELIEVE, and that knowledge was the thing
that lifted the great Edison above the common herd.
Men with negative minds told F. W. Woolworth, he would go "broke"
trying to run a store on five and ten cent sales. He did not believe them. He knew
that he could do anything, within reason, if he backed his plans with faith.
Exercising his right to keep other men's negative suggestions out of his mind, he
piled up a fortune of more than a hundred million dollars.
Men with negative minds told George Washington he could not hope to
win against the vastly superior forces of the British, but he exercised his Divine
right to BELIEVE, therefore this book was published under the protection of the
Stars and Stripes, while the name of Lord Cornwallis has been all but forgotten.
Doubting Thomases scoffed scornfully when Henry Ford tried out his first
crudely built automobile on the streets of Detroit. Some said the thing never
would become practical. Others said no one would pay money for such a
contraption.
FORD SAID, "I'LL BELT THE EARTH WITH DEPENDABLE MOTOR
CARS," AND HE DID!
His decision to trust his own judgment has already piled up a fortune far
greater than the next five generations of his descendents can squander. For the
benefit of those seeking vast riches, let it be remembered that practically the sole
difference between Henry Ford and a majority of the more than one hundred
thousand men who work for him, is this—FORD HAS A MIND AND
CONTROLS IT, THE OTHERS HAVE MINDS WHICH THEY DO NOT TRY TO
CONTROL.
Henry Ford has been repeatedly mentioned, because he is an astounding
example of what a man with a mind of his own, and a will to control it, can
accomplish. His record knocks the foundation from under that time-worn alibi, "I
never had a chance." Ford never had a chance, either, but he CREATED AN
OPPORTUNITY AND BACKED IT WITH PERSISTENCE UNTIL IT MADE HIM
RICHER THAN CROESUS.
Mind control is the result of self-discipline and habit. You either control
your mind or it controls you. There is no hall-way compromise. The most
practical of all methods for controlling the mind is the habit of keeping it busy
with a definite purpose, backed by a definite plan. Study the record of any man
who achieves noteworthy success, and you will observe that he has control over


his own mind, moreover, that he exercises that control and directs it toward the
attainment of definite objectives. Without this control, success is not possible.

"FIFTY-SEVEN" FAMOUS ALIBIS
By Old Man IF
People who do not succeed have one distinguishing trait in common. They
know all the reasons for failure, and have what they believe to be air-tight alibis to
explain away their own lack of achievement.
Some of these alibis are clever, and a few of them are justifiable by the
facts. But alibis cannot be used for money. The world wants to know only one
thing—HAVE YOU ACHIEVED SUCCESS?
A character analyst compiled a list of the most commonly used alibis. As
you read the list, examine yourself carefully, and determine how many of these
alibis, if any, are your own property. Remember, too, the philosophy presented
in this book makes every one of these alibis obsolete.
IF I didn't have a wife and family . . .
IF I had enough "pull" . . .
IF I had money . . .
IF I had a good education . . .
IF I could get a job . . .

IF other people understood me . . .
IF conditions around me were only different . . .
IF I could live my life over again . . .
IF I did not fear what "THEY" would say . . .
IF I had been given a chance . . .
IF I now had a chance . . .
IF other people didn't "have it in for me" . . .
IF nothing happens to stop me . . .
IF I were only younger . . .
IF I could only do what I want . . .
IF I had been born rich . . .

IF I dared assert myself . . .
IF I only had embraced past opportunities . . .
IF people didn't get on my nerves . . .

IF I hadn't lost my money . . .
IF I lived in a different neighborhood . . .
IF I didn't have a "past" . . .
IF I only had a business of my own . . .
IF other people would only listen to me . . .
IF * * * and this is the greatest of them all * * * I had the courage to see myself as I
really am, I would find out what is wrong with me, and correct it, then I might have

a chance to profit by my mistakes and learn something from the experience of
others, for I know that there is something WRONG with me, or I would now be
where I WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I had spent more time analyzing my
weaknesses, and less time building alibis to cover them.
Building alibis with which to explain away failure is a national pastime.
The habit is as old as the human race, and is fatal to success! Why do people cling
to their pet alibis? The answer is obvious. They defend their alibis because THEY
CREATE them! A man's alibi is the child of his own imagination. It is human
nature to defend one's own brain-child.
Building alibis is a deeply rooted habit. Habits are difficult to break,
especially when they provide justification for something we do. Plato had this
truth in mind when he said, "The first and best victory is to conquer self. To be
conquered by self is, of all things, the most shameful and vile."
Another philosopher had the same thought in mind when he said, "It was
a great surprise to me when I discovered that most of the ugliness I saw in
others, was but a reflection of my own nature."
"It has always been a mystery to me," said Elbert Hubbard, "why people
spend so much time deliberately fooling themselves by creating alibis to cover
their weaknesses. If used differently, this same time would be sufficient to cure
the weakness, then no alibis would be needed."
In parting, I would remind you that "Life is a checkerboard, and the player
opposite you is TIME. If you hesitate before moving, or neglect to move
promptly, your men will be wiped off the board by TIME. You are playing
against a partner who will not tolerate INDECISION!"
Previously you may have had a logical excuse for not having forced Life
to come through with whatever you asked, but that alibi is now obsolete, because
you are in possession of the Master Key that unlocks the door to Life's bountiful
riches.
The Master Key is intangible, but it is powerful! It is the privilege of
creating, in your own mind, a BURNING DESIRE for a definite form of riches.
There is no penalty for the use of the Key, but there is a price you must pay if you
do not use it. The price is FAILURE. There is a reward of stupendous proportions
if you put the Key to use. It is the satisfaction that comes to all who conquer self
and force Life to pay whatever is asked.
The reward is worthy of your effort. Will you make the start and be
convinced?

"If we are related," said the immortal Emerson, "we shall meet." In closing,
may I borrow his thought, and say, "If we are related, we have, through these
pages, met."

THE END
